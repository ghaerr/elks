.TH man 1 "ELKS System Utilities" "ELKS" \" -*- nroff -*-
.SH NAME
man \- display on-line reference manuals
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B man
[\-w] [\-b|\-q] [section-number] page ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
This document describes the ELKS version of
.BR man .
This version is extremely minimal and should not be used whenever using a
better version is practical.
.B man
is the system's manual pager. Each
.I page
argument given is the name of a program, file, function system call or other
system feature which should be documented in the systems manual.
.B man
will try and locate and display a manual page for each
.I page
operand given. If a numeric
.I section
operand is given, then
.B man
will only look in that section of the manual, rather than all the sections
which is the default.
.PP
Here is a list of the manual sections:-
.PP
1 Program or shell commands
.br
2 System calls in the kernel
.br
3 Functions in a the libraries
.br
4 Special device files
.br
5 File formats
.br
6 Games
.br
7 Macro packages
.br
8 System administration programs
.br
9 Kernel routines
.PP
Unlike other man program, this one does not use an external formatter such
as nroff, as we currently do not have one. It supports a subset of nroff
-man features which are sufficient for displaying ELKS manual pages.
