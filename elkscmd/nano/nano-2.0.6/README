	GNU nano - an enhanced clone of the Pico text editor.

Overview

     The nano project was started because of a few "problems" with the
     wonderfully easy-to-use and friendly Pico text editor.

     First and foremost is its license: the Pine suite does not use the
     GPL or a GPL-friendly license, and has unclear restrictions on
     redistribution.  Because of this, Pine and Pico are not included
     with many GNU/Linux distributions.  Also, other features (like go
     to line number or search and replace) were unavailable until
     recently or require a command line flag.  Yuck.

     nano aims to solve these problems by emulating the functionality of
     Pico as closely as possible while addressing the problems above and
     perhaps providing other extra functionality.

     The nano editor is now an official GNU package.  For more
     information on GNU and the Free Software Foundation, please see
     http://www.gnu.org/.

How to compile and install nano

     Download the nano source code, then:
     tar zxvf nano-x.y.z.tar.gz
     cd nano-x.y.z
     ./configure
     make
     make install

     It's that simple.  Use --prefix with configure to override the
     default installation directory of /usr/local.
     
     If you configured with the "--enable-nanorc" option, after
     installation you might copy the doc/nanorc.sample to your home
     directory, rename it to ".nanorc", and then edit it according to
     your taste.
