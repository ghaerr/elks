The files in this directory (tinfo) are those that support the terminfo
database and interfaces for ncurses.  The terminfo library can be built
separately, as a lower-level library for ncurses, but usually is bundled.

In addition to the standard documented interfaces, ncurses uses internal
functions which reside in tinfo to satisfy linkage requirements.
