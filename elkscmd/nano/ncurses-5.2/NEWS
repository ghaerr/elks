This is a log of changes that ncurses has gone through since Zeyd started
working with Pavel Curtis' original work, pcurses, in 1992.

Changes through 1.9.9e are recorded by Zeyd M. Ben-Halim.
Changes since 1.9.9e are recorded by Thomas Dickey.

20001021 5.2 release for upload to ftp.gnu.org
	+ update generated html files from manpages.
	+ modify dist.mk to use edit_man.sh to substitute autoconf'd variables
	  in html manpages.
	+ fix an uninitialized pointer in read_termcap.c (report by Todd C
	  Miller, from report/patch by Philip Guenther <guenther@gac.edu>).
	+ correct help-message and array limit in knight.c (patch by Brian
	  Raiter <breadbox@muppetlabs.com>).
	> patch by Juergen Pfeifer:
	+ fix to avoid warning by GNAT-3.13p about use of inconsistent casing
	  for some identifiers defined in the standard package.
	+ cosmetic change to forms/fty_enum.c

20001014
	+ correct an off-by-one position in test/railroad.c which could cause
	  wrapping at the right margin.
	+ test/repair some issues with libtool configuration.  Make
	  --disable-echo force libtool --silent.  (Libtool does not work for
	  OS/2 EMX, works partly for SCO - libtool is still very specific to
	  gcc).
	+ change default of --with-manpage-tbl to "no", since for most of the
	  platforms which do have tbl installed, the system "man" program
	  understands how to run tbl automatically.
	+ minor improvement to force_bar() in comp_parse.c (Bernhard
	  Rosenkraenzer <bero@redhat.de>).
	+ modify lib_tparm.c to use get_space() before writing terminating
	  null character, both for consistency as well as to ensure that if
	  save_char() was called immediately before, that the allocated memory
	  is enough (patch by Sergei Ivanov).
	+ add note about termcap ML capability which is duplicated between two
	  different capabilities:  smgl and smglr (reported by Sergei Ivanov
	  <svivanov@pdmi.ras.ru>).
	+ correct parameter counts in include/Caps for dclk as well as some
	  printer-specific capabilities: csnm, defc, scs, scsd, smgtp, smglp.
	> patch by Johnny C Lam <lamj@stat.cmu.edu>:
	+ add support for building with libtool (apparently version 1.3.5,
	  since old versions do not handle -L../lib), using new configure
	  option --with-libtool.
	+ add configure option --with-manpage-tbl, which causes the manpages to
	  be preprocessed by tbl(1) prior to installation,
	+ add configure option --without-curses-h, which causes the
	  installation process to install curses.h as ncurses.h and make
	  appropriate changes to headers and manpages.

20001009
	+ correct order of options/parameters in run_tic.in invocation of tic,
	  which did not work with standard getopt() (reported by Ethan
	  Butterfield <primus@veris.org>).
	+ correct logic for 'reverse' variable in lib_vidattr.c, which was
	  setting it true without checking if newmode had A_REVERSE set, e.g.,
	  using $TERM=ansi on OS/2 EMX (see 20000917).
	> patch by Todd Miller:
	+ add a few missing use_terminfo_vars() and fixes up _nc_tgetent().
	  Previously, _nc_cgetset() would still get called on cp so the
	  simplest thing is to set cp to NULL if !use_terminfo_vars().
	+ added checks for an empty $HOME environment variable.
	> patches by Ilya Zakharevich for OS/2 EMX:
	+ modify convert_configure.pl to support INSTALL.  Change compiler
	  options in that script to use multithreading, needed for the mouse.
	+ modify OS/2 mouse support, retrying as a 2-button mouse if code fails
	  to set up a 3-button mouse.
	+ improve code for OS/2 mouse support, using _nc_timed_wait() to
	  replace select() call.

20001007
	+ change type of ospeed variable back to short to match its use in
	  legacy applications (reported by Andrey A Chernov).
	+ add case to configure script for --enable-rpath on IRIX (patch by
	  Albert Chin-A-Young).
	+ minor fix to position_check() function, to ensure it gets the whole
	  cursor report before decoding.
	+ add configure option --disable-assumed-color, to allow pre-5.1
	  convention of default colors used for color-pair 0 to be configured
	  (see assume_default_colors()).
	+ rename configure option --enable-hashmap --disable-hashmap, and
	  reorder the configure options, splitting the experimental and
	  development 
	+ add configure option --disable-root-environ, which tells ncurses to
	  disregard $TERMINFO and similar environment variables if the current
	  user is root, or running setuid/setgid (based on discussion with
	  several people).
	+ modified misc/run_tic.in to use tic -o, to eliminate dependency on
	  $TERMINFO variable for installs.
	+ add table entry for plab_norm to tput, so it passes in strings
	  for that capability.
	+ modify parse_format() in lib_tparm.c to ignore precision if it is
	  longer than 10000 (report by Jouko Pynnonen).
	+ rewrote limit checks in lib_mvcur.c using new functions
	  _nc_safe_strcat(), etc.  Made other related changes to check lengths
	  used for strcat/strcpy (report by Jouko Pynnonen <jouko@solutions.fi>).

20000930
	+ modify several descriptions, including those for setaf, setab, in
	  include/Caps to indicate that the entries are parameterized.  This
	  information is used to tell which strings are translated when
	  converting to termcap.  Fixes a problem where the generated termcap
	  would contain a spurious "%p1" for the terminfo "%p1%d".
	+ modify ld -rpath options (e.g., Linux, and Solaris) to use an
	  absolute pathname for the build tree's lib directory (prompted by
	  discussion with Albert Chin-A-Young).
	+ modify "make install.man" and "make uninstall.man" to include tack's
	  man-page.
	+ various fixes for install scripts used to support configure --srcdir
	  and --with-install-prefix (reported by Matthew Clarke
	  <Matthew_Clarke@mindlink.bc.ca>).
	+ make configure script checks on variables $GCC and $GXX consistently
	  compare against 'yes' rather than test if they are nonnull, since
	  either may be set to the corresponding name of the C or C++ compiler
	  (report/patch by Albert Chin-A-Young).

20000923
	+ modify rs2 capability in xterm-r6 and similar where cursor
	  save/restore bracketed the sequence for resetting video attributes. 
	  The cursor restore would undo that (from a NetBSD bug report by John
	  Hawkinson <jhawk@MIT.EDU>).
	+ using parameter check added to tic, corrected 27 typos in
	  terminfo.src -TD
	+ modify tic to verify that its inputs are really files, in case
	  someone tries to read a directory (or /dev/zero).
	+ add a check for empty buffers returned by fgets() in comp_scan.c
	  next_char() function, in case tic is run on a non-text file (fixes
	  a core dump reported by Aaron Campbell <aaron@cs.dal.ca>).
	+ add to railroad.c some code exercising tgoto(), providing an
	  alternate form of display if the terminal supports cursor addressing.
	+ split-out tgoto() again, this time into new file lib_tgoto.c, and
	  implement a conventional BSD-style tgoto() which is used if the
	  capability string does not contain terminfo-style padding or
	  parameters (requested by Andrey A Chernov).
	+ add check to tic which reports capabilities that do not reference
	  the expected number of parameters.
	+ add error checking to infocmp's -v and -m options to ensure that
	  the option value is indeed a number.

20000917
	+ add S0, E0 extensions to screen's terminfo entry, which is another
	  way to solve the misconfiguration issue -TD
	+ completed special case for tgoto from 20000916

20000916
	+ update xterm terminfo entries to match XFree86 xterm patch #146 -TD
	+ add Matrix Orbital terminfo entries (from Eric Z Ayers
	  <eric@ale.org>).
	+ add special case to lib_tparm.c to allow 'screen' program to use a
	  termcap-style parameter "%." to tgoto() for switching character sets.
	+ use LN_S substitution in run_tic.in, to work on OS/2 EMX which has
	  no symbolic links.
	+ updated notes in README.emx regarding autoconf patches.
	+ replace a lookup table in lib_vidattr.c used to decode no_color_video
	  with a logic expression (suggested by Philippe Blain).
	+ add a/A toggle to ncurses.c 'b' test, which clears/sets alternate
	  character set attribute from the displayed text.
	+ correct inequality in parameter analysis of rewritten lib_tparm.c
	  which had the effect of ignoring p9 in set_attributes (sgr), breaking
	  alternate character set (reported by Piotr Majka <charvel@link.pl>).
	+ correct ifdef'ing for GCC_PRINTF, GCC_SCANF which would not compile
	  with Sun WorkShop compilers since these tokens were empty (cf: 
	  20000902, reported by Albert Chin-A-Young).

20000909
	+ correct an uninitialized parameter to open_tempfile() in tic.c which
	  made "tic -I" give an ambiguous error message about tmpnam.
	+ add special case in lib_vidattr.c to reset underline and standout for
	  devices that have no sgr0 defined (patch by Don Lewis
	  <Don.Lewis@tsc.tdk.com>).  Note that this will not work for bold
	  mode, since there is no exit-bold-mode capability.
	+ improved patch for Make_Enum_Type (patch by Juergen Pfeifer).
	+ modify tparm to disallow arithmetic on strings, analyze the varargs
	  list to read strings as strings and numbers as numbers.
	+ modify tparm's internal function spop() to treat a null pointer as
	  an empty string.
	+ modify tput program so it can be renamed or invoked via a link as
	  'reset' or 'init', producing the same effect as 'tput reset' or 'tput
	  init'.
	+ add private entrypoint _nc_basename(), use to consolidate related
	  code in progs, as well as accommodating OS/2 EMX pathnames.
	+ remove NCURSES_CONST line from edit_cfg.sh to compensate for its
	  removal (except via AC_SUBST) from configure.in, making --enable-const
	  work again (reported by Juergen Pfeifer).
	+ regen'd configure to pick up "hpux*" change from 20000902.

20000902
	+ modify tset.c to check for transformed "reset" program name, if any.
	+ add a check for null pointer in Make_Enum_Type() (reported by Steven
	  W Orr <steveo@world.std.com>).
	+ change functions _nc_parse_entry() and postprocess_termcap() to avoid
	  using strtok(), because it is non-reentrant (reported by Andrey A
	  Chernov <ache@nagual.pp.ru>).
	+ remove "hpux10.*" case from CF_SHARED_OPTS configure script macro.
	  This differed from the "hpux*" case by using reversed symbolic
	  links, which made the 5.1 version not match the configuration of
	  5.0 shared libraries (reported by Albert Chin-A-Young).
	+ correct a dependency in Ada95/src/Makefile.in which prevented
	  building with configure --srcdir (patch by H Nanosecond
	  <aldomel@ix.netcom.com>).
	+ modify ifdef's in curses.h.in to avoid warning if GCC_PRINTF or
	  GCC_SCANF was not previously defined (reported by Pavel Roskin
	  <proski@gnu.org>).
	+ add MKncurses_def.sh to generate fallback definitions for
	  ncurses_cfg.h, to quiet gcc -Wundef warnings, modified ifdef's in
	  code to consistently use "#if" rather than "#ifdef".

20000826
	+ add QNX qansi entries to terminfo -TD
	+ add os2 entry to misc/emx.src (<jmcoopr@webmail.bmi.net>).
	+ add configure option --with-database to allow specifying a different
	  terminfo source-file to install.  On OS/2 EMX, this defaults to
	  misc/emx.src
	+ change misc/run_tic.sh to derive it from misc/run_tic.in, to simplify
	  setting .exe extension on OS/2 EMX.
	+ add .exe extension in Ada95/gen/Makefile.in,
	  Ada95/samples/Makefile.in, for OS/2 EMX (reported by
	  <jmcoopr@webmail.bmi.net>).
	+ add configure check for filesystems (such as OS/2 EMX) which do not
	  distinguish between upper/lowercase filenames, use this to fix tags
	  rules in makefiles.
	+ initialize fds[] array to 0's in _nc_timed_wait(); apparently poll()
	  only sets the revents members of that array when there is activity
	  corresponding to the related file (report by Glenn Cooper
	  <gcooper@qantas.com.au>, using Purify on Solaris 5.6).
	+ change configure script to use AC_CANONICAL_SYSTEM rather than
	  AC_CANONICAL_HOST, which means that configure --target will set
	  a default program-prefix.
	+ add note on cross-compiling to INSTALL (which does not rely on the
	  AC_CANONICAL_* macros).

20000819
	+ add cases for EMX OS/2 to config.guess, config.sub
	+ new version of config.guess, config.sub from lynx 2.8.4dev.7
	+ add definitions via transform.h to allow tic and tput to check for
	  the transformed aliases rather than the original infotocap, etc.
	+ simplify transform-expressions in progs/Makefile.in, make the
	  uninstall rule work for transformed program names.
	+ change symbol used by --install-prefix configure option from
	  INSTALL_PREFIX to DESTDIR (the latter has become common usage
	  although the name is misleading).
	+ modify programs to use curses_version() string to report the version
	  of ncurses with which they are compiled rather than the
	  NCURSES_VERSION string.  The function returns the patch level in
	  addition to the major and minor version numbers.

20000812
	+ modify CF_MAN_PAGES configure macro to make transformed program names
	  a parameter to that macro rather than embedding them in the macro.
	+ newer config.guess, config.sub (reference version used in lynx
	  2.8.4dev.7).
	+ add configure option --with-default-terminfo-dir=DIR to allow
	  specifying the default terminfo database directory (request by Albert
	  Chin-A-Young).
	+ minor updates for terminfo.src from FreeBSD termcap change-history.
	+ correct notes in README and INSTALL regarding documentation files
	  that were moved from misc directory to doc (report by Rich Kulawiec
	  <rsk@gsp.org>).
	+ change most remaining unquoted parameters of 'test' in configure
	  script to use quotes, for instance fixing a problem in the
	  --disable-database option (reported by Christian Mondrup
	  <scancm@biobase.dk>).
	+ minor adjustments to work around some of the incompatibilities/bugs
	  in autoconf 2.29a alpha.
	+ add -I/usr/local/include when --with-ncurses option is used in
	  test/configure script.
	+ correct logic in adjust_cancels(), which did not check both
	  alternatives when reclassifying an extended name between boolean,
	  number and string, causing an infinite loop in tic.

20000730
	+ correct a missing backslash in curses.priv.h

20000729
	+ change handling of non_dest_scroll_region in tty_update.c to clear
	  text after it is shifted in rather than before shifting out.  Also
	  correct row computation (reported by Ruediger Kuhlmann
	  <uck4@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de>).
	+ add/use new trace function to display chtype values from winch() and
	  getbkgd().
	+ add trace mask TRACE_ATTRS, alter several existing _tracef calls that
	  trace attribute changes under TRACE_CALLS to use this.
	+ modify MKlib_gen.sh so that functions returning chtype will call
	  returnChar().
	+ add returnChar() trace, for functions returning chtype.
	+ change indent.pro to line up parenthesis.

20000722
	+ fix a heap problem with the c++ binding (report by
	  <alexander_liberson@ninewest.com>, patch by Juergen Pfeifer).
	+ minor adjustment to ClrToEOL() to handle an out-of-bounds parameter.
	+ modify the check for big-core to force a couple of memory accesses,
	  which may work as needed for older/less-capable machines (if not,
	  there's still the explicit configure option).
	> fixes based on diff's for Amiga and BeOS found at
	  http://www.mathematik.uni-karlsruhe.de/~kuhlmann/cross/ncurses/
	+ alter definition of NCURSES_CONST to make it non-empty.
	+ add amiga-vnc terminfo entry.
	+ redefine 'TEXT' in menu.h for AMIGA, since it is reported to have
	  an (unspecified) symbol conflict.
	+ replaced case-statement in _nc_tracebits() for CSIZE with a table to
	  simplify working around implementations that define random
	  combinations of the related macros to zero.
	+ modify configure test for tcgetattr() to allow for old
	  implementations, e.g., on BeOS, which only defined it as a macro.
	> patches by Bruno Haible:
	+ when checking LC_ALL/LC_CTYPE/LANG environment variables for UTF-8
	  locale, ignore those which are set to an empty value, as per SUSV2.
	+ encode 0xFFFD in UTF-8 with 3 bytes, not 2.
	+ modify _nc_utf8_outch() to avoid sign-extension when checking for
	  out-of-range value.

20000715
	+ correct manlinks.sed script to avoid using ERE "\+", which is not
	  understood by older versions of sed (patch by Albert Chin-A-Young).
	+ implement configure script options that transform installed program
	  names, e.g., --program-prefix, including the manpage names and cross
	  references (patch by Albert Chin-A-Young <china@thewrittenword.com>).
	+ correct several mismatches between manpage filename and ".TH"
	  directives, renaming dft_fgbg.3x to default_colors.3x and
	  menu_attribs.3x to menu_attributes.3x (report by Todd C Miller).
	+ correct missing includes for <string.h> in several places, including
	  the C++ binding.  This is not noted by gcc unless we use the
	  -fno-builtin option (reported by Igor Schein <igor@txc.com>).
	+ modified progs/tset.c and tack/sysdep.c to build with sgttyb
	  interface if neither termio or termios is available.  Tested this
	  with FreeBSD 2.1.5 (which does have termios - but the sgttyb does
	  work).

20000708 5.1 release for upload to ftp.gnu.org
	+ document configure options in INSTALL.
	+ add man-page for ncurses trace functions.
	+ correct return value shown in curs_touch.3x for is_linetouched() and
	  is_wintouched(), in curs_initscr.3x for isendwin(), and in
	  curs_termattr.3x for has_ic() and has_il().
	+ add prototypes for touchline() and touchwin(), adding them to the
	  list of generated functions.
	+ modify fifo_push() to put ERR into the fifo just like other values to
	  return from wgetch().  It was returning without doing that, making
	  end-of-file condition incorrectly return a 0 (reported by Todd C
	  Miller).
	+ uncomment CC_SHARED_OPTS for progs and tack (see 971115), since they
	  are needed for SCO OpenServer.
	+ move _nc_disable_period from free_ttype.c to comp_scan.c to appease
	  dynamic loaders on SCO and IRIX64.
	+ add "-a" option to test/ncurses.c to invoke assume_default_colors()
	  for testing.
	+ correct assignment in assume_default_colors() which tells ncurses
	  whether to use default colors, or the assumed ones (reported by Gary
	  Funck <gary@Intrepid.Com>).
	+ review/correct logic in mk-1st.awk for making symbolic links for
	  shared libraries, in particular for FreeBSD, etc.
	+ regenerate misc/*.def files for OS/2 EMX dll's.
	+ correct quoting of values for CC_SHARED_OPTS in aclocal.m4 for
	  cases openbsd2*, openbsd*, freebsd* and netbsd* (patch by Peter
	  Wemm) (err in 20000610).
	+ minor updates to release notes, as well as adding/updating URLs for
	  examples cited in announce.html
	> several fixes from Philippe Blain <philippe.blain2@freesbee.fr>:
	+ correct placement of ifdef for NCURSES_XNAMES in function
	  _nc_free_termtype(), fixes a memory leak.
	+ add a call to _nc_synchook() to the end of function whline() like
	  that in wvline() (difference was in 1.9.4).
	+ make ClearScreen() a little faster by moving two instances of
	  UpdateAttr() out of for-loops.
	+ simplify ClrBottom() by eliminating the tstLine data, using for-loops
	  (cf: 960428).

20000701 pre-release
	+ change minor version to 1, i.e., ncurses 5.1
	+ add experimental configure option --enable-colorfgbg to check for
	  $COLORTERM variable as set by rxvt/aterm/Eterm.
	+ add Eterm terminfo entry (Michael Jennings <mej@valinux.com>).
	+ modify manlinks.sed to pick aliases from the SYNOPSIS section, and
	  several manpages so manlinks.sed can find aliases for creating
	  symbolic links.
	+ add explanation to run_tic.sh regarding extended terminal
	  capabilities.
	+ change message format for edit_cfg.sh, since some people interpret
	  it as a warning.
	+ correct unescaped '$' in sysv5uw7*|unix_sv* rule for CF_SHARED_OPTS
	  configure macro (report by Thanh Ma <Thanh.Ma@casi-rusco.com>).
	+ correct logic in lib_twait.c as used by lib_mouse.c for GPM mouse
	  support when poll() is used rather than select() (prompted by
	  discussion with David Allen <DAllen24@aol.com>).

20000624 pre-release
	+ modify TransformLine() to check for cells with different color pairs
	  that happen to render the same display colors.
	+ apply $NCURSES_NO_PADDING to cost-computation in mvcur().
	+ improve cost computation in PutRange() by accounting for the use
	  of parm_right_cursor in mvcur().
	+ correct cost computation in EmitRange(), which was not using the
	  normalized value for cursor_address.
	+ newer config.guess, config.sub (reference version used in TIN 1.5.6).

20000617
	+ update config.guess, config.sub (reference version used in PCRE 3.2).
	+ resync changes to gnathtml against version 1.22, regenerated html
	  files under doc/html/ada using this (1.22.1.1).
	+ regenerated html files under doc/html/man after correcting top and
	  bottom margin options for man2html in dist.mk
	+ minor fixes to test programs ncurses 'i' and testcurs program to make
	  the subwindow's background color cover the subwindow.
	+ modify configure script so AC_MSG_ERROR is temporarily defined to a
	  warning in AC_PROG_CXX to make it recover from a missing C++ compiler
	  without requiring user to add --without-cxx option (from comment by
	  Akim Demaille <akim@epita.fr> to autoconf mailing list).
	+ modify headers.sh to avoid creating temporary files in the build
	  directory when installing headers (reported by Sergei Pokrovsky
	  <pok@nbsp.nsk.su>)

20000610
	+ regenerated the html files under doc/html/ada/files and
	  doc/html/ada/funcs with a slightly-improved gnathtml.
	+ add kmous capability to linux terminfo entry to allow it to use
	  xterm-style events provided by gpm patch by Joerg Schoen.
	+ make the configure macro CF_SHARED_OPTS a little smarter by testing
	  if -fPIC is supported by gcc rather than -fpic.  The former option
	  allows larger symbol tables.
	+ update config.guess and config.sub (patches by
	  Kevin Buettner <kev@primenet.com> for elf64_ia64
	  Bernd Kuemmerlen <bkuemmer@mevis.de> and MacOS X).
	+ add warning for 'tic -cv' about use of '^?' in terminfo source, which
	  is an extension.

20000527
	+ modify echo() behavior of getch() to match Solaris curses for
	  carriage return and backspace (reported by Neil Zanella).
	+ change _nc_flush() to a function.
	+ modify delscreen() to check if the output stream has been closed, and
	  if so, free the buffer allocated for setbuf (this provides an
	  ncurses-specific way to avoid a memory leak when repeatedly calling
	  newterm reported by Chipp C <at_1@zdnetonebox.com>).
	+ correct typo in curs_getch.3x manpage regarding noecho (reported by
	  David Malone <dwmalone@maths.tcd.ie>).
	+ add a "make libs" rule.
	+ make the Ada95 interface build with configure --enable-widec.
	+ if the configure --enable-widec option is given, append 'w' to names
	  of the generated libraries (e.g., libncursesw.so) to avoid conflict
	  with existing ncurses libraries.

20000520
	+ modify view.c to make a rudimentary viewer of UTF-8 text if ncurses
	  is configured with the experimental wide-character support.
	+ add a simple UTF-8 output driver to the experimental wide-character
	  support.  If any of the environment variables LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE or
	  LANG contain the string "UTF-8", this driver will be used to
	  translate the output to UTF-8.  This works with XFree86 xterm.
	+ modify configure script to allow building shared libraries on BeOS
	  (from a patch by by Valeriy E Ushakov).
	+ modify lib_addch.c to allow repeated update to the lower-right
	  corner, rather than displaying only the first character written until
	  the cursor is moved.  Recent versions of SVr4 curses can update the
	  lower-right corner, and behave this way (reported by Neil Zanella).
	+ add a limit-check in _nc_do_color(), to avoid using invalid color
	  pair value (from bug report by Brendan O'Dea <bod@compusol.com.au>).

20000513
	+ the tack program knows how to use smcup and rmcup but the "show caps
	  that can be tested" feature did not reflect this knowledge.  Correct
	  the display in the menu tack/test/edit/c (patch by Daniel Weaver). 
	+ xterm-16color does allow bold+colors, removed ncv#32 from that
	  terminfo entry.

20000506
	+ correct assignment to SP->_has_sgr_39_49 in lib_dft_fgbg.c, which
	  broke check for screen's AX capability (reported by Valeriy E Ushakov
	  <uwe@ptc.spbu.ru>).
	+ change man2html rule in dist.mk to workaround bug in some man-programs
	  that ignores locale when rendering hyphenation.
	+ change web- and ftp-site to dickey.his.com

20000429
	+ move _nc_curr_token from parse_entry.c to comp_scan.c, to work around
	  problem linking tack on MacOS X DP3.
	+ include <sys/time.h> in lib_napms.c to compile on MacOS X DP3
	  (reported by Gerben Wierda <wierda@holmes.nl>).
	+ modify lib_vidattr.c to check for ncv fixes when pair-0 is not
	  default colors.
	+ add -d option to ncurses.c, to turn on default-colors for testing.
	+ add a check to _nc_makenew() to ensure that newwin() and newpad()
	  calls do not silently fail by passing too-large limits.
	+ add symbol NCURSES_SIZE_T to use rather than explicit 'short' for
	  internal window and pad sizes.  Note that since this is visible in
	  the WINDOW struct, it would be an ABI change to make this an 'int'
	  (prompted by a question by Bastian Trompetter
	  <btrompetter@firemail.de>, who attempted to create a 96000-line pad).

20000422
	+ add mgterm terminfo entry from NetBSD, minor adjustments to sun-ss5,
	  aixterm entries -TD
	+ modify tack/ansi.c to make it more tolerant of bad ANSI replies.  An
	  example of an illegal ANSI resonse can be found using Microsoft's
	  Telnet client.  A correct display can be found using a VT-4xx
	  terminal or XFree86 xterm with:
		XTerm*VT100*decTerminalID:  450
	  (patch by Daniel Weaver).
	+ modify gdc.c to recognize 'q' for quit, 's' for single-step and ' '
	  for resume.  Add '-n' option to force gdc's standard input to
	  /dev/null, to both illustrate the use of newterm() for specifying
	  alternate inputs as well as for testing signal handling.
	+ minor fix for configure option --with-manpage-symlinks, for target
	  directories that contain a period ('.') (reported by Larry Virden).

20000415
	+ minor additions to beterm entry (feedback from Rico Tudor) -TD
	+ corrections/updates for some IBM terminfo entries -TD
	+ modify _nc_screen_wrap() so that when exiting curses mode with
	  non-default colors, the last line on the screen will be cleared to
	  the screen's default colors (request by Alexander Lukyanov).
	+ modify ncurses.c 'r' example to set nonl(), allowing control/M to be
	  read for demonstrating the REQ_NEW_LINE operation (prompted by a
	  question by Tony L Keith" <tlkeith@keithconsulting.com>).
	+ modify ncurses.c 'r' example of field_info() to work on Solaris 2.7,
	  documented extension of ncurses which allows a zero pointer.
	+ modify fmt_complex() to avoid buffer overflow in case of excess
	  recursion, and to recognize "%e%?" as a synonym for else-if, which
	  means that it will not recur for that special case.
	+ add logic to support $TERMCAP variable in case the USE_GETCAP symbol
	  is defined (patch by Todd C Miller).
	+ modify one of the m4 files used to generate the Ada95 sources,
	  to avoid using the token "symbols" (patch by Juergen Pfeifer).

20000408
	+ add terminfo entries bsdos-pc-m, bsdos-pc-mono (Jeffrey C Honig)
	+ correct spelling error in terminfo entry name:  bq300-rv was given as
	  bg300-rv in esr's version.
	+ modify redrawwin() macro so its parameter is fully parenthesized
	  (fixes Debian bug report #61088).
	+ correct formatting error in dump_entry() which set incorrect column
	  value when no newline trimming was needed at the end of an entry,
	  before appending "use=" clauses (cf: 960406).

20000401
	+ add configure option --with-manpage-symlinks
	+ change unctrl() to render C1 characters (128-159) as ~@, ~A, etc.
	+ change makefiles so trace() function is provided only if TRACE is
	  defined, e.g., in the debug library.  Modify related calls to
	  _tracechar() to use unctrl() instead.

20000325
	+ add screen's AX capability (for ECMA SGR 39 and 49) to applicable
	  terminfo entries, use presence of this as a check for a small
	  improvement in setting default colors.
	+ improve logic in _nc_do_color() implementing assume_default_colors()
	  by passing in previous color pair info to eliminate redundant call to
	  set_original_colors().  (Part of this is from a patch by Alexander
	  Lukyanov).
	+ modify warning in _nc_trans_string() about a possibly too-long string
	  to do this once only rather than for each character past the
	  threshold (600).  Change interface of _nc_trans_string() to allow
	  check for buffer overflow.
	+ correct use of memset in _nc_read_entry_source() to initialize ENTRY
	  struct each time before reading new data into it, rather than once
	  per loop (cf:  990301).  This affects multi-entry in-core operations
	  such as "infocmp -Fa".

20000319
	+ remove a spurious pointer increment in _nc_infotocap() changes from
	  20000311.  Add check for '.' in format of number, since that also
	  is not permitted in termcap.
	+ correct typo in rxvt-basic terminfo from temporary change made while
	  integrating 20000318.

20000318
	+ revert part of the vt220 change (request by Todd C Miller).
	+ add ansi-* terminfo entries from Eric's version.
	+ add -a option to tic and infocmp, which retains commented-out
	  capabilities during source translation/comparison, e.g., captoinfo
	  and infotocap.
	+ modify cardfile.c to display an empty card if no input data file is
	  found, fixes a core dump in that case (reported by Bruno Haible).
	+ correct bracketing in CF_MATH_LIB configure macro, which gave wrong
	  result for OS/2 EMX.
	+ supply required parameter for _nc_resolve_uses() call in
	  read_termcap.c, overlooked in 20000311 (reported by Todd C Miller).
	> patches by Bruno Haible <haible@ilog.fr>:
	+ fix a compiler warning in fty_enum.c
	+ correct LIB_PREFIX expression for DEPS_CURSES in progs, tack
	  makefiles, which resulted in redundant linking (cf: 20000122).

20000311
	+ make ifdef's for BROKEN_LINKER consistent (patch by Todd C Miller).
	+ improved tack/README (patch by Daniel Weaver).
	+ modify tput.c to ensure that unspecified parameters are passed to
	  tparm() as 0's.
	+ add a few checks in infocmp to guard against buffer overflow when
	  displaying string capabilities.
	+ add check for zero-uses in infocmp's file_comparison() function
	  before calling _nc_align_termtype().  Otherwise one parameter is
	  indexed past the end of the uses-array.
	+ add an option -q to infocmp to specify the less verbose output,
	  keeping the existing format as the default, though not retaining the
	  previous behavior that made the -F option compare each entry to
	  itself.
	+ adapted patch by Eric Raymond to make infocmp -F less verbose
	  (the submitted patch was unusable because it did not compile
	  properly):
	  + modify write_entry.c to ensure that absent or cancelled booleans
	    are written as FALSE, for consistency with infocmp which now
	    assumes this.  Note that for the small-core configuration, tic
	    may not produce the same result as before.
	  + change some private library interfaces used by infocmp, e.g.,
	    _nc_resolve_uses().
	  + add a check in _nc_infotocap() to ensure that cm-style capabilities
	    accept only %d codes when converting the format from terminfo to
	    termcap.
	  + modify ENTRY struct to separate the data in 'parent' into the name
	    and link values (the original idea to merge both into 'parent' was
	    not good).
	  + discard repair_acsc(tterm);
	> patch by Juergen Pfeifer:
	+ drop support for gnat 3.10
	+ move generated documentation and html files under ./doc directory,
	  adding makefile rules for this to dist.mk

20000304
	+ correct conflicting use of tparm() in 20000226 change to tic, which
	  made it check only one entry at a time.
	+ fix errors in ncurses-intro.html and hackguide.html shown by Dave
	  Raggett's tidy.
	+ make the example in ncurses-intro.html do something plausible, and
	  corrected misleading comment (reported by Neil Zanella).
	+ modify pnoutrefresh() to set newscr->_leaveok as wnoutrefresh() does,
	  to fix a case where the cursor position was not updated as in
	  Solaris  (patch by David Mosberger <davidm@hpl.hp.com>).
	+ add a limit-check for wresize() to ensure that a subwindow does not
	  address out of bounds.
	+ correct offsets used for subwindows in wresize() (patch by Michael
	  Andres <ma@suse.de>).
	+ regenerate html'ized manual pages with man2html 3.0.1 (patch by
	  Juergen Pfeifer).  This generated a file with a space in its name,
	  which I removed.
	+ fix a few spelling errors in tack.
	+ modify tack/Makefile.in to match linker options of progs/Makefile.in;
	  otherwise it does not build properly for older HPUX shared library
	  configurations.
	+ add several terminfo entries from esr's "11.0".

20000226
	+ make 'tput flash' work properly for xterm by flushing output in
	  delay_output() when using napms(), and modifying xterm's terminfo to
	  specify no padding character.  Otherwise, xterm's reported baud rate
	  can mislead ncurses into producing too few padding characters
	  (Debian #58530).
	+ add a check to tic for consistency between sgr and the separate
	  capabilities such as smso, use this to check/correct several
	  terminfo entries (Debian #58530).
	+ add a check to tic if cvvis is the same as cnorm, adjusted several
	  terminfo entries to remove the conflict (Debian #58530).
	+ correct prototype shown in attr_set()/wattr_set() manpages (fixes
	  Debian #53962).
	+ minor clarification for curs_set() and leaveok() manpages.
	+ use mkstemp() for creating temporary file for tic's processing of
	  $TERMCAP contents (fixes Debian #56465).
	+ correct two errors from integrating Alexander's changes:  did not
	  handle the non-bce case properly in can_erase_with() (noted by
	  Alexander), and left fg/bg uninitialized in the pair-zero case of
	  _nc_do_color() (reported by Dr Werner Fink <werner@suse.de> and
	  Ismael Cordeiro <ismael@cordeiro.com>).

20000219
	+ store default-color code consistently as C_MASK, even if given as
	  -1 for convenience (adapted from patches by Alexander Lukyanov).
	> patches by Alexander Lukyanov:
	+ change can_clear_with() macro to accommodate logic for
	  assume_default_colors(), making most of the FILL_BCE logic
	  unnecessary.  Made can_clear_with() an inline function to make it
	  simpler to read.

20000212
	+ corrected form of recent copyright dates.
	+ minor corrections to xterm-xf86-v333 terminfo entry -TD
	> patches by Alexander Lukyanov:
	+ reworded dft_fgbg.3x to avoid assuming that the terminal's default
	  colors are white on black.
	+ fix initialization of tstLine so that it is filled with current blank
	  character in any case.  Previously it was possible to have it filled
	  with old blank.  The wrong over-optimization was introduced in 991002
	  patch.  (it is not very critical as the only bad effect is not using
	  clr_eos for clearing if blank has changed).

20000205
	+ minor corrections/updates to several terminfo entries: rxvt-basic,
	  vt520, vt525, ibm5151, xterm-xf86-v40 -TD
	+ modify ifdef's for poll() to allow it to use <sys/poll.h>, thereby
	  allowing poll() to be used on Linux.
	+ add CF_FUNC_POLL macro to check if poll() is able to select from
	  standard input.  If not we will not use it, preferring select()
	  (adapted from patch by Michael Pakovic <mpakovic@fdn.com>).
	+ update CF_SHARED_OPTS macro for SCO Unixware 7.1 to allow building
	  shared libraries (reported/tested by Thanh <thanhma@mediaone.net>).
	+ override $LANGUAGE in build to avoid incorrect ordering of keynames.
	+ correct CF_MATH_LIB parameter, must be sin(x), not sqrt(x).

20000122
	+ resync CF_CHECK_ERRNO and CF_LIB_PREFIX macros from tin and xterm.
	+ modify CF_MATH_LIB configure macro to parameterize the test function
	  used, for reuse in dialog and similar packages.
	+ correct tests for file-descriptors in OS/2 EMX mouse support.  A
	  negative value could be used by FD_SET, causing the select() call
	  to wait indefinitely.

20000115
	+ additional fixes for non-bce terminals (handling of delete_character)
	  to work when assume_default_colors() is not specified.
	+ modify warning message from _nc_parse_entry() regarding extended
	  capability names to print only if tic/infocmp/toe have the -v flag
	  set, and not at all in ordinary user applications.  Otherwise, this
	  warning would be shown for screen's extended capabilities in programs
	  that use the termcap interface (reported by Todd C Miller).
	+ modify use of _nc_tracing from programs such as tic so their debug
	  level is not in the same range as values set by trace() function.
	+ small panel header cleanup (patch by Juergen Pfeifer).
	+ add 'railroad' demo for termcap interface.
	+ modify 'tic' to write its usage message to stderr (patch by Todd C
	  Miller).

20000108
	+ add prototype for erase() to curses.h.in, needed to make test
	  programs build with c++/g++.
	+ add .c.i and .c.h suffix rules to generated makefiles, for debugging.
	+ correct install rule for tack.1; it assumed that file was in the
	  current directory (reported by Mike Castle <dalgoda@ix.netcom.com>).
	+ modify terminfo/termcap translation to suppress acsc before trying
	  sgr if the entry would be too large (patch by Todd C Miller).
	+ document a special case of incompatiblity between ncurses 4.2 and
	  5.0, add a section for this in INSTALL.
	+ add TRACE_DATABASE flag for trace().

20000101
	+ update mach, add mach-color terminfo entries based on Debian diffs
	  for ncurses 5.0 -TD
	+ add entries for xterm-hp, xterm-vt220, xterm-vt52 and xterm-noapp
	  terminfo entries -TD
	+ change OTrs capabilities to rs2 in terminfo.src -TD
	+ add obsolete and extended capabilities to 'screen' terminfo -TD
	+ corrected conversion from terminfo rs2 to termcap rs (cf: 980704)
	+ make conversion to termcap ug (underline glitch) more consistently
	  applied.
	+ fix out-of-scope use of 'personal[]' buffer in 'toe' (this error
	  was in the original pre-1.9.7 version, when $HOME/.terminfo was
	  introduced).
	+ modify 'toe' to ignore terminfo directories to which it has no
	  permissions.
	+ modify read_termtype(), fixing 'toe', which could dump core when it
	  found an incomplete entry such as "dumb" because it did not
	  initialize its buffer for _nc_read_file_entry().
	+ use -fPIC rather than -fpic for shared libraries on Linux, not
	  needed for i386 but some ports (from Debian diffs for 5.0).
	+ use explicit VALID_NUMERIC() checks in a few places that had been
	  overlooked, and add a check to ensure that init_tabs is nonzero,
	  to avoid divide-by-zero (reported by Todd C Miller).
	+ minor fix for CF_ANSI_CC_CHECK configure macro, for HPUX 10.x (from
	  tin).

19991218
	+ reorder tests during mouse initialization to allow for gpm to run in
	  xterm, or for xterm to be used under OS/2 EMX.  Also drop test for
	  $DISPLAY in favor of kmous=\E[M or $TERM containing "xterm" (report
	  by Christian Weisgerber <naddy@mips.rhein-neckar.de>).
	+ modify raw() and noraw() to clear/restore IEXTEN flag which affects
	  stty lnext on systems such as FreeBSD (report by Bruce Evans
	  <bde@zeta.org.au>, via Jason Evans <jasone@canonware.com>).
	+ fix a potential (but unlikely) buffer overflow in failed() function
	  of tset.c (reported by Todd C Miller).
	+ add manual-page for ncurses extensions, documented curses_version(),
	  use_extended_names().

19991211
	+ treat as untranslatable to termcap those terminfo strings which
	  contain non-decimal formatting, e.g., hexadecimal or octal.
	+ correct commented-out capabilities that cannot be translated to
	  termcap, which did not check if a colon must be escaped.
	+ correct termcap translation for "%>" and "%+", which did not check
	  if a colon must be escaped, for instance.
	+ use save_string/save_char for _nc_captoinfo() to eliminate fixed
	  buffer (originally for _nc_infotocap() in 960301 -TD).
	+ correct expression used for terminfo equivalent of termcap %B,
	  adjust regent100 entry which uses this.
	+ some cleanup and commenting of ad hoc cases in _nc_infotocap().
	+ eliminate a fixed-buffer in tic, used for translating comments.
	+ add manpage for infotocap

19991204
	+ add kvt and gnome terminfo entries -TD
	+ correct translation of "%%" by infotocap, which was emitted as "%".
	+ add "obsolete" termcap strings to terminfo.src
	+ modify infocmp to default to showing obsolete capabilities rather
	  than terminfo only.
	+ modify write_entry.c so that if extended names (i.e., configure
	  --enable-tcap-names) are active, then tic will also write "obsolete"
	  capabilities that are present in the terminfo source.
	+ modify tic so that when running as captoinfo or infotocap, it
	  initializes the output format as in -C and -I options, respectively.
	+ improve infocmp and tic -f option by splitting long strings that do
	  not have if-then-else construct, but do have parameters, e.g., the
	  initc for xterm-88color.
	+ refine MKtermsort.sh slightly by using bool for the *_from_termcap
	  arrays.

19991127
	+ additional fixes for non-bce terminals (handling of clear_screen,
	  clr_eol, clr_eos, scrolling) to work when assume_default_colors() is
	  not specified.
	+ several small changes to xterm terminfo entries -TD.
	+ move logic for _nc_windows in lib_freeall.c inside check for nonnull
	  SP, since it is part of that struct.
	+ remove obsolete shlib-versions, which was unintentionally re-added
	  in 970927.
	+ modify infocmp -e, -E options to ensure that generated fallback.c
	  type for Booleans agrees with term.h (reported by Eric Norum
	  <eric@cls.usask.ca>).
	+ correct configure script's use of $LIB_PREFIX, which did not work
	  for installing the c++ directory if $libdir did not end with "/lib"
	  (reported by Huy Le <huyle@ugcs.caltech.edu>).
	+ modify infocmp so -L and -f options work together.
	+ modify the initialization of SP->_color_table[] in start_color() so
	  that color_content() will return usable values for COLORS greater
	  than 8.
	+ modify ncurses 'd' test in case COLORS is greater than 16, e.g., for
	  xterm-88color, to limit the displayed/computed colors to 16.
	> patch by Juergen Pfeifer:
	+ simplify coding of the panel library according to suggestions by
	  Philippe Blain.
	+ improve macro coding for a few macros in curses.priv.h

19991113
	+ modify treatment of color pair 0 so that if ncurses is configured
	  to support default colors, and they are not active, then ncurses
	  will set that explicitly, not relying on orig_colors or orig_pair.
	+ add new extension, assume_default_colors() to provide better control
	  over the use of default colors.
	+ modify test programs to use more-specific ifdef's for existence of
	  wresize(), resizeterm() and use_default_colors().
	+ modify configure script to add specific ifdef's for some functions
	  that are included when --enable-ext-funcs is in effect, so their
	  existence can be ifdef'd in the test programs.
	+ reorder some configure options, moving those extensions that have
	  evolved from experimental status into a new section.
	+ change configure --enable-tcap-names to enable this by default.

19991106
	+ install tack's manpage (reported by Robert Weiner
	  <robert@progplus.com>)
	+ correct worm.c's handling of KEY_RESIZE (patch by Frank Heckenbach).
	+ modify curses.h.in, undef'ing some symbols to avoid conflict with C++
	  STL (reported by Matt Gerassimoff <mgeras@ticon.net>)

19991030
	+ modify linux terminfo entry to indicate that dim does not mix with
	  color (reported by Klaus Weide <kweide@enteract.com>).
	+ correct several typos in terminfo entries related to missing '['
	  in CSI's -TD
	+ fix several compiler warnings in c++ binding (reported by Tim
	  Mooney for alphaev56-dec-osf4.0f
	+ rename parameter of _nc_free_entries() to accommodate lint.
	+ correct lint rule for tack, used incorrect list of source files.
	+ add case to config.guess, config.sub for Rhapsody.
	+ improve configure tests for libg++ and libstdc++ by omitting the
	  math library (which is missing on Rhapsody), and improved test for
	  the math library itself (adapted from path by Nelson H. F. Beebe).
	+ explicitly initialize to zero several data items which were
	  implicitly initialized, e.g., cur_term.  If not explicitly
	  initialized, their storage type is C (common), and causes problems
	  linking on Rhapsody 5.5 using gcc 2.7.2.1 (reported by Nelson H. F.
	  Beebe).
	+ modify Ada95 binding to not include the linker option for Ada
	  bindings in the Ada headers, but in the Makefiles instead (patch by
	  Juergen Pfeifer).

19991023 5.0 release for upload to ftp.gnu.org
	+ effective with release of 5.0, change NCURSES_VERSION_PATCH to
	  4-digit year.
	+ add function curses_version(), to return ncurses library version
	  (request by Bob van der Poel).
	+ remove rmam, smam from cygwin terminfo entry.
	+ modify FreeBSD cons25 terminfo entry to add cnorm and cvvis, as well
	  as update ncv to indicate that 'dim' conflicts with colors.
	+ modify configure script to use symbolic links for FreeBSD shared
	  libraries by default.
	+ correct ranf() function in rain and worm programs to ensure it does
	  not return 1.0
	+ hide the cursor in hanoi.c if it is running automatically.
	+ amend lrtest.c to account for optimizations that exploit margin
	  wrapping.
	+ add a simple terminfo demo, dots.c
	+ modify SIGINT/SIGQUIT handler to set a flag used in _nc_outch() to
	  tell it to use write() rather than putc(), since the latter is not
	  safe in a signal handler according to POSIX.
	+ add/use internal macros _nc_flush() and NC_OUTPUT to hide details
	  of output-file pointer in ncurses library.
	+ uncomment CC_SHARED_OPTS (see 971115), since they are needed for SCO
	  OpenServer.
	+ correct CC_SHARED_OPTS for building shared libraries for SCO
	  OpenServer.
	+ remove usleep() from alternatives in napms(), since it may interact
	  with alarm(), causing a process to be interrupted by SIGALRM (with
	  advice from Bela Lubkin).
	+ modify terminal_interface-curses-forms.ads.m4 to build/work with
	  GNAT 3.10 (patch by Juergen Pfeifer).
	+ remove part of CF_GPP_LIBRARY configure-script macro, which did not
	  work with gcc 2.7.2.3
	+ minor fix to test/tclock.c to avoid beeping more than once per second
	+ add 's' and ' ' decoding to test/rain.c

991016	pre-release
	+ corrected BeOS code for lib_twait.c, making nodelay() function work.

991009	pre-release
	+ correct ncurses' value for cursor-column in PutCharLR(), which was
	  off-by-one in one case (patch by Ilya Zakharevich).
	+ fix some minor errors in position_check() debugging code, found while
	  using this to validate the PutCharLR() patch.
	+ modify firework, lrtest, worm examples to be resizable, and to
	  recognize 'q' for quit, 's' for single-step and ' ' for resume.
	+ restore reverted change to  terminal_interface-curses-forms.ads.m4,
	  add a note on building with gnat 3.10p to Ada95/TODO.
	+ add a copy of the standalone configure script for the test-directory
	  to simplify testing on SCO and Solaris.

991002	pre-release
	+ minor fixes for _nc_msec_cost(), color_content(), pair_content(),
	  _nc_freewin(), ClrBottom() and onscreen_mvcur() (analysis by Philippe
	  Blain, comments by Alexander Lukyanov).
	+ simplify definition of PANEL and eliminate internal functions
	  _nc_calculate_obscure(), _nc_free_obscure() and _nc_override(),
	  (patch by Juergen Pfeifer, based on analysis by Philippe Blain
	  <bledp@voila.fr>)).
	+ change renaming of dft_fgbg.3x to use_default_colors.3ncurses in
	  man_db.renames, since Debian is not concerned with 14-character
	  filename limitation (from Debian bug report by Josip Rodin
	  <joy@cibalia.gkvk.hr>).
	+ corrected scoansi terminfo entry by testing with scoterm and console.
	+ revert change from 990614 to terminal_interface-curses-forms.ads.m4,
	  since this does not work for gnat 3.10p
	+ modify tclock example to be resizable (if ncurses' sigwinch handler
	  is used), and in color.
	+ use $(CC) rather than 'gcc' in MK_SHARED_LIB symbols, used for Linux
	  shared library rules.

990925	pre-release
	+ add newer NetBSD console terminfo entries
	+ add amiga-8bit terminfo entry (from Henning 'Faroul' Peters
	  <Faroul@beyond.kn-bremen.de>)
	+ remove -lcurses -ltermcap from configure script's check for the gpm
	  library, since they are not really necessary (a properly configured
	  gpm library has no dependency on any curses library), and if the
	  curses library is not installed, this would cause the test to fail.
	+ modify tic's -C option so that terminfo "use=" clauses are translated
	  to "tc=" clauses even when running it as captoinfo.
	+ modify CF_STDCPP_LIBRARY configure macro to perform its check only
	  for GNU C++, since that library conflicts with SGI's libC on IRIX-6.2
	+ modify CF_SHARED_OPTS configure macro to support build on NetBSD with
	  ELF libraries (patch by Bernd Ernesti <bernd@arresum.inka.de>).
	+ correct a problem in libpanel, where the _nc_top_panel variable was
	  not set properly when bottom_panel() is called to hide a panel which
	  is the only one on the stack (report/analysis by Michael Andres
	  <ma@suse.de>, patch by Juergen Pfeifer).

990918	pre-release
	+ add acsc string to HP 70092 terminfo entry (patch by Joerg Wunsch
	  <j@interface-business.de>).
	+ add top-level uninstall.data and uninstall.man makefile rules.
	+ correct logic of CF_LINK_FUNCS configure script, from BeOS changes so
	  that hard-links work on Unix again.
	+ change default value of cf_cv_builtin_bool to 1 as suggested by
	  Jeremy Buhler, making it less likely that a conflicting declaration
	  of bool will be seen when compiling with C++.

990911	pre-release
	+ improved configure checks for builtin.h
	+ minor changes to C++ binding (remove static initializations, and make
	  configure-test for parameter initializations) for features not
	  allowed by vendor's C++ compilers (reported by Martin Mokrejs, this
	  applies to SGI, though I found SCO has the same characteristics).
	+ corrected quoting of ETIP_xxx definitions which support old versions
	  of g++, e.g., those using -lg++
	+ remove 'L' code from safe_sprintf.c, since 'long double' is not
	  widely portable.  safe_sprintf.c is experimental, however, and
	  exists mainly as a fallback for systems without snprintf (reported
	  by Martin Mokrejs <mmokrejs@natur.cuni.cz>, for IRIX 6.2)
	+ modify definition of _nc_tinfo_fkeys in broken-linker configuration
	  so that it is not unnecessarily made extern (Jeffrey C Honig).

990904	pre-release
	+ move definition for builtin.h in configure tests to specific check
	  for libg++, since qt uses the same filename incompatibly.
	+ correct logic of lib_termcap.c tgetstr function, which did not copy
	  the result to the buffer parameter.  Testing shows Solaris does
	  update this, though of course tgetent's buffer is untouched (from
	  mpc.lists.freebsd.current newsgroup item by Peter Edwards
	  <peter.edwards@ireland.com>).
	+ corrected beterm terminfo entry, which lists some capabilities which
	  are not actually provided by the BeOS Terminal.
	+ add special logic to replace select() calls on BeOS, whose select()
	  function works only for sockets.
	+ correct missing escape in mkterm.h.awk.in, which caused part
	  of the copyright noticed to be omitted (reported by Peter
	  Wemm <peter@netplex.com.au>).
	> several small changes to make the c++ binding and demo work on OS/2
	  EMX (related to a clean reinstall of EMX):
	+ correct library-prefix for c++ binding; none is needed.
	+ add $x suffix to make_hash and make_keys so 'make distclean' works.
	+ correct missing $x suffix for tack, c++ demo executables.
	+ split CF_CXX_LIBRARY into CF_GPP_LIBRARY (for -lg++) and
	  CF_STDCPP_LIBRARY (for -lstdc++)

990828	pre-release
	+ add cygwin terminfo entry -TD
	+ modify CF_PROG_EXT configure macro to set .exe extension for cygwin.
	+ add configure option --without-cxx-binding, modifying the existing
	  --without-cxx option to check only for the C++ compiler
	  characteristics.  Whether or not the C++ binding is needed, the
	  configure script checks for the size/type of bool, to make ncurses
	  match.  Otherwise C++ applications cannot use ncurses.

990821	pre-release
	+ updated configure macros CF_MAKEFLAGS, CF_CHECK_ERRNO
	+ minor corrections to beterm terminfo entry.
	+ modify lib_setup.c to reject values of $TERM which have a '/' in them.
	+ add ifdef's to guard against CS5, CS6, CS7, CS8 being zero, as more
	  than one is on BeOS.  That would break a switch statement.
	+ add configure macro CF_LINK_FUNCS to detect and work around BeOS's
	  nonfunctional link().
	+ improved configure macros CF_BOOL_DECL and CF_BOOL_SIZE to detect
	  BeOS's bool, which is declared as an unsigned char.

990814	pre-release
	+ add ms-vt100 terminfo entry -TD
	+ minor fixes for misc/emx.src, based on testing with tack.
	+ minor fix for test/ncurses.c, test 'a', in case ncv is not set.

990731	pre-release
	+ minor correction for 'screen' terminfo entry.
	+ clarify description of errret values for setupterm in manpage.
	+ modify tput to allow it to emit capabilities for hardcopy terminals
	  (patch by Goran Uddeborg <goeran@uddeborg.pp.se>).
	+ modify the 'o' (panel) test in ncurses.c to show the panels in color
	  or at least in bold, to test Juergen's change to wrefresh().
	> patches by Juergen Pfeifer:
	+ Fixes a problem using wbkgdset() with panels.  It has actually
	  nothing to with panels but is a problem in the implementation of
	  wrefresh().  Whenever a window changes its background attribute to
	  something different than newscr's background attribute, the whole
	  window is touched to force a copy to newscr.  This is an unwanted
	  side-effect of wrefresh() and it is actually not necessary.  A changed
	  background attribute affects only further outputs of background it
	  doesn't mean anything to the current content of the window.  So there
	  is no need to force a copy.  (reported by Frank Heckenbach
	  <frank@g-n-u.de>).
	+ an upward compatible enhancement of the NCursesPad class in the C++
	  binding.  It allows one to add a "viewport" window to a pad and then
	  to use panning to view the pad through the viewport window.

990724	pre-release
	+ suppress a call to def_prog_mode() in the SIGTSTP handler if the
	  signal was received while not in curses mode, e.g., endwin() was
	  called in preparation for spawning a shell command (reported by Frank
	  Heckenbach <frank@g-n-u.de>)
	+ corrected/enhanced xterm-r5, xterm+sl, xterm+sl-twm terminfo entries.
	+ change test for xterm mouse capability:  it now checks only if the
	  user's $DISPLAY variable is set in conjunction with the kmous
	  capability being present in the terminfo.  Before, it checked if any
	  of "xterm", "rxvt" or "kterm" were substrings of the terminal name.
	  However, some emulators which are incompatible with xterm in other
	  ways do support the xterm mouse capability.
	+ reviewed and made minor changes in ncurses to quiet g++ warnings
	  about shadowed or uninitialized variables.  g++ incorrectly warns
	  about uninitialized variables because it does not take into account
	  short-circuit expression evaluation.
	+ change ncurses 'b' test to start in color pair 0 and to show in the
	  right margin those attributes which are suppressed by no_color_video,
	  i.e., "(NCV)".
	+ modify ifdef's in curses.h so that __attribute__ is not redefined
	  when compiling with g++, but instead disabled the macros derived for
	  __attribute__ since g++ does not consistently recognize the same
	  keywords as gcc (reported by Stephan K Zitz <zitz@erf.net>).
	+ update dependencies for term.h in ncurses/modules (reported by
	  Ilya Zakharevich).

990710	pre-release
	+ modify the form demo in ncurses.c to illustrate how to manipulate the
	  field appearance, e.g, for highlighting or translating the field
	  contents.
	+ correct logic in write_entry from split-out of home_terminfo in
	  980919, which prevented update of $HOME/.terminfo (reported by Philip
	  Spencer <pspencer@fields.utoronto.ca>).

990703	pre-release
	+ modify linux terminfo description to make use of kernel 2.2.x mods
	  that support cursor style, e.g., to implement cvvis (patch by Frank
	  Heckenbach <frank@g-n-u.de>)
	+ add special-case in setupterm to retain previously-saved terminal
	  settings in cur_term, which happens when curses and termcap calls are
	  mixed (from report by Bjorn Helgaas <helgaas@dhc.net>).
	+ suppress initialization of key-tries in _nc_keypad() if we are only
	  disabling keypad mode, e.g., in endwin() called when keypad() was not.
	+ modify the Ada95 makefile to ensure that always the Ada files from
	  the development tree are used for building and not the eventually
	  installed ones (patch by Juergen Pfeifer).

990626	pre-release
	+ use TTY definition in tack/sysdep.c rather than struct termios
	  (reported by Philippe De Muyter).
	+ add a fallback for strstr, used in lib_mvcur.c and tack/edit.c,
	  not present on sysV68 (reported by Philippe De Muyter).
	+ correct definition in comp_hash.c to build with configure
	  --with-rcs-ids option.

990619	pre-release
	+ modified ifdef's for sigaction and sigvec to ensure we do not try to
	  handle SIGTSTP if neither is available (from report by Philippe De
	  Muyter).
	> patch by Philippe De Muyter:
	+ in tic.c, use `unlink' if `remove' is not available.
	+ use only `unsigned' as fallback value for `speed_t'.  Some files used
	  `short' instead.

990616	pre-release
	+ fix some compiler warnings in tack.
	+ add a check for predefined bool type in CC, based on report that
	  BeOS predefines a bool type.
	+ correct logic for infocmp -e option (i.e., the configure
	  --with-fallbacks option), which I'd not updated when implementing
	  extended names (cf:  990301).  The new implementation adds a -E
	  option to infocmp.
	> patch by Juergen Pfeifer:
	+ introduce the private type Curses_Bool in the Ada95 binding
	  implementation.  This is to clearly represent the use of "bool" also
	  in the binding.  It should have no effect on the generated code.
	+ improve the man page for field_buffer() to tell the people, that the
	  whole buffer including leading/trailing spaces is returned.  This is
	  a common source of confusion, so it's better to document it clearly.

990614	pre-release
	> patch by Juergen Pfeifer:
	+ use pragma PreElaborate in several places.
	+ change a few System.Address uses to more specific types.
	+ change interface version-number to 1.0
	+ regenerate Ada95 HTML files.

990612	pre-release
	+ modify lib_endwin.c to avoid calling reset_shell_mode(), return ERR
	  if it appears that curses was never initialized, e.g., by initscr().
	  For instance, this guards against setting the terminal modes to
	  strange values if endwin() is called after setupterm().  In the same
	  context, Solaris curses will dump core.
	+ modify logic that avoids a conflict in lib_vidattr.c between sgr0 and
	  equivalent values in rmso or rmul by ensuring we do not modify the
	  data which would be returned by the terminfo or termcap interfaces
	  (reported by Brad Pepers <brad@linuxcanada.com>, cf:  960706).
	+ add a null-pointer check for SP in lib_vidattr.c to logic that checks
	  for magic cookies.
	+ improve fallback declaration of 'bool' when the --without-cxx option
	  is given, by using a 'char' on i386 and related hosts (from discussion
	  with Alexander Lukyanov).

990605	pre-release
	+ include time.h in lib_napms.c if nanosleep is used (patch by
	  R Lindsay Todd <toddr@rpi.edu>).
	+ add an "#undef bool" to curses.h, in case someone tries to define it,
	  e.g., perl.
	+ add check to tparm to guard against divide by zero (reported by Aaron
	  Campbell <aaron@ug.cs.dal.ca>).

990516	pre-release
	+ minor fix to build tack on CLIX (mismatched const).
	> patch by Juergen Pfeifer:
	+ change Juergen's old email address with new one in the files where it
	  is referenced.  The Ada95 HTML pages are regenerated.
	+ update MANIFEST to list the tack files.

990509	pre-release
	+ minor fixes to make 'tack' build/link on NeXT (reported by Francisco
	  A. Tomei Torres).

990417	pre-release
	+ add 'tack' program (which is GPL'd), updating it to work with the
	  modified TERMTYPE struct and making a fix to support setaf/setab
	  capabilities.  Note that the tack program is not part of the
	  ncurses libraries, but an application which can be distributed with
	  ncurses.  The configure script will ignore the directory if it is
	  omitted, however.
	+ modify gpm mouse support so that buttons 2 and 3 are used for
	  select/paste only when shift key is pressed, making them available
	  for use by an application (patch by Klaus Weide).
	+ add complete list of function keys to scoansi terminfo entry - TD

990410	pre-release
	+ add a simple test program cardfile.c to illustrate how to read form
	  fields, and showing forms within panels.
	+ change shared-library versioning for the Hurd to be like Linux rather
	  than *BSD (patch by Mark Kettenis <kettenis@wins.uva.nl>).
	+ add linux-lat terminfo entry.
	+ back-out _nc_access check in read_termcap.c (both incorrect and
	  unnecessary, except to guard against a small window where the file's
	  ownership may change).

990403	pre-release
	+ remove conflicting _nc_free_termtype() function from test module
	  lib_freeall.c
	+ use _nc_access check in read_termcap.c for termpaths[] array (noted
	  by Jeremy Buhler, indicating that Alan Cox made a similar patch).
	> patch by Juergen Pfeifer:
	+ modify menu creation to not inherit status flag from the default menu
	  which says that the associated marker string has been allocated and
	  should be freed (bug reported by Marek Paliwoda" <paliwoda@kki.net.pl>)

990327	pre-release (alpha.gnu.org:/gnu/ncurses-5.0-beta1.tar.gz)
	+ minor fixes to xterm-xfree86 terminfo entry - TD.
	+ split up an expression in configure script check for ldconfig to
	  workaround limitation of BSD/OS sh (reported by Jeff Haas
	  <jmh@mail.msen.com>).
	+ correct a typo in man/form_hook.3x (Todd C Miller).

990318	pre-release
	+ parenthesize and undef 'index' symbol in c++ binding and demo, to
	  accommodate its definition on NeXT (reported by Francisco A. Tomei
	  Torres).
	+ add sigismember() to base/sigaction.c compatibility to link on NeXT
	  (reported by Francisco A. Tomei Torres).
	+ further refinements to inequality in hashmap.c to cover a case with
	  ^U in nvi (patch by Alexander Lukyanov).

990316	pre-release
	+ add fallback definition for getcwd, to link on NeXT.
	+ add a copy of cur_term to tic.c to make it link properly on NeXT
	  (reported by Francisco A. Tomei Torres).
	+ change inequality in hashmap.c which checks the distance traveled by
	  a chunk so that ^D command in nvi (scrolls 1/2 screen) will use
	  scrolling logic (patch by Alexander Lukyanov, reported by Jeffrey
	  C Honig).

990314	pre-release
	+ modify lib_color.c to handle a special case where the curscr
	  attributes have been made obsolete (patch by Alexander Lukyanov).
	+ update BSD/OS console terminfo entries to use klone+sgr and
	  klone+color (patch by Jeffrey C Honig).
	+ update glibc addon configure script for extended capabilities.
	+ correct a couple of warnings in the --enable-const configuration.
	+ make comp_hash build properly with _nc_strdup(), on NeXT (reported by
	  Francisco A. Tomei Torres <francisco.tomei@cwix.com>).

990313	pre-release
	+ correct typos in linux-c initc string - TD
	+ add 'crt' terminfo entry, update xterm-xfree86 entry - TD
	+ remove a spurious argument to tparm() in lib_sklrefr.c (patch by
	  Alexander Lukyanov).

990307	pre-release
	+ back-out change to wgetch because it causes a problem with ^Z
	  handling in lynx (reported by Kim DeVaughn).

990306	pre-release
	+ add -G option to tic and infocmp, to reverse the -g option.
	+ recode functions in name_match.c to avoid use of strncpy, which
	  caused a 4-fold slowdown in tic (cf: 980530).
	+ correct a few warnings about sign-extension in recent changes.
	> patch by Juergen Pfeifer:
	+ fixes suggested by Jeff Bradbury <jibradbury@lucent.com>:
	  + improved parameter checking in new_fieldtype().
	  + fixed a typo in wgetch() timeout handling.
	  + allow slk_init() to be called per newterm call.  The internal SLK
	    state is stored in the SCREEN struct after every newterm() and then
	    reset for the next newterm.
	  + fix the problem that a slk_refresh() refreshes stdscr if the
	    terminal has true SLKs.
	+ update HTML documentation for Ada binding.

990301	pre-release
	+ remove 'bool' casts from definitions of TRUE/FALSE so that statements
	  such as "#if TRUE" work.  This was originally done to allow for a C++
	  compiler which would warn of implicit conversions between enum and
	  int, but is not needed for g++ (reported by Kim DeVaughn).
	+ add use_extended_names() function to allow applications to suppress
	  read of the extended capabilities.
	+ add configure option --enable-tcap-names to support logic which
	  allows ncurses' tic to define new (i.e., extended) terminal
	  capabilities.  This is activated by the tic -x switch.  The infocmp
	  program automatically shows or compares extended capabilities.
	  Note:  This changes the Strings and similar arrays in the TERMTYPE
	  struct so that applications which manipulate it must be recompiled.
	+ use macros typeMalloc, typeCalloc and typeRealloc consistently
	  throughout ncurses library.
	+ add _nc_strdup() to doalloc.c.
	+ modify define_key() to allow multiple strings to be bound to the
	  same keycode.
	+ correct logic error in _nc_remove_string, from 990220.
	> patch by Juergen Pfeifer, for Ada95 binding:
	+ regenerate some of the html documentation
	+ minor cleanup in terminal_interface-curses.adb

990220	pre-release
	+ resolve ambiguity of kend/kll/kslt and khome/kfnd/kich1 strings in
	  xterm and ncsa terminfo entries by removing the unneeded ones.  Note
	  that some entries will return kend & khome versus kslt and kfnd, for
	  PC-style keyboards versus strict vt220 compatiblity - TD
	+ add function keybound(), which returns the definition associated with
	  a given keycode.
	+ modify define_key() to undefine the given string when no keycode is
	  given.
	+ modify keyok() so it works properly if there is more than one string
	  defined for a keycode.
	+ add check to tic to warn about terminfo descriptions that contain
	  more than one key assigned to the same string.  This is shown only if
	  the verbose (-v) option is given.  Moved related logic (tic -v) from
	  comp_parse.c into the tic program.
	+ add/use _nc_trace_tries() to show the function keys that will be
	  recognized.
	+ rename init_acs to _nc_init_acs (request by Alexander Lukyanov).
	> patch by Juergen Pfeifer, for Ada95 binding:
	+ remove all the *_adabind.c from ncurses, menu and form projects.
	  Those little helper routines have all been implemented in Ada and are
	  no longer required.
	+ The option handling routines in menu and form have been made more
	  save.  They now make sure that the unused bits in options are always
	  zero.
	+ modify configuration scripts to
	  + use gnatmake as default compiler name.  This is a safer choice than
	    gcc, because some GNAT implementations use other names for the
	    compilerdriver to avoid conflicts.
	  + use new default installation locations for the Ada files according
	    to the proposed GNU Ada filesystem standard (for Linux).
	+ simplify the Makefiles for the Ada binding
	+ rename ada_include directory to src.

990213
	+ enable sigwinch handler by default.
	+ disable logic that allows setbuf to be turned off/on, because some
	  implementations will overrun the buffer after it has been disabled
	  once.

990206
	+ suppress sc/rc capabilities from terminal description if they appear
	  in smcup/rmcup.  This affects only scrolling optimization, to fix a
	  problem reported by several people with xterm's alternate screen,
	  though the problem is more general.
	> patch by Juergen Pfeifer, for Ada95 binding:
	+ removed all pragma Preelaborate() stuff, because the just released
	  gnat-3.11p complains on some constructs.
	+ fixed some upper/lower case notations because gnat-3.11p found
	  inconsistent use.
	+ used a new method to generate the HTML documentation of the Ada95
	  binding.  This invalidates nearly the whole ./Ada95/html subtree.
	  Nearly all current files in this subtree are removed

990130
	+ cache last result from _nc_baudrate, for performance (suggested by
	  Alexander Lukyanov).
	+ modify ClrUpdate() function to workaround a problem in nvi, which
	  uses redrawwin in SIGTSTP handling.  Jeffrey C Honig reported that
	  ncurses repainted the screen with nulls before resuming normal
	  operation (patch by Alexander Lukyanov).
	+ generalize is_xterm() function a little by letting xterm/rxvt/kterm
	  be any substring rather than the prefix.
	+ modify lib_data.c to initialize SP.  Some linkers, e.g., IBM's, will
	  not link a module if the only symbols exported from the module are
	  uninitialized ones (patch by Ilya Zakharevich, who says that he has
	  seen messages claiming this behaviour conforms to the standard.)
	+ move call on _nc_signal_handler past _nc_initscr, to avoid a small
	  window where Nttyb hasn't yet been filled (reported by Klaus Weide).
	+ modify lib_tstp.c to block SIGTTOU when handling SIGTSTP, fixes a
	  problem where ncurses applications which were run via a shell script
	  would hang when given a ^Z.  Also, check if the terminal's process
	  group is consistent, i.e., a shell has not taken ownership of it,
	  before deciding to save the current terminal settings in the SIGTSTP
	  handler (patch by Klaus Weide).
	+ correct spelling of ACS_ names in curs_border.3x (reported by Bob van
	  der Poel <bvdpoel@kootenay.com>).
	+ correct a couple of typos in the macros supporting the configure
	  --with-shlib-version option.

990123
	+ modify fty_regex.c to compile on HAVE_REGEXPR_H_FUNCS machine (patch
	  by Kimio Ishii <ishii@csl.sony.co.jp>).
	+ rename BSDI console terminfo entries:  bsdos to bsdos-pc-nobold, and
	  bsdos-bold to bsdos-pc (patch by Jeffrey C Honig).
	+ modify tput to accept termcap names as an alternative to terminfo
	  names (patch by Jeffrey C Honig).
	+ correct a typo in term.7 (Todd C Miller).
	+ add configure --with-shlib-version option to allow installing shared
	  libraries named according to release or ABI versions.  This
	  parameterizes some existing logic in the configure script, and is
	  intended for compatiblity upgrades on Digital Unix, which used
	  versioned libraries in ncurses 4.2, but no longer does (cf:  980425).
	+ resync configure script against autoconf 2.13 + patches
	+ minor improvements for teraterm terminfo entry based on the program's
	  source distribution.

990116
	+ change default for configure --enable-big-core to assume machines do
	  have enough memory to resolve terminfo.src in-memory.
	+ correct name of ncurses library in TEST_ARGS when configuring with
	  debug library.
	+ minor fixes to compile ncurses library with broken-linker with g++.
	+ add --enable-broken-linker configure option, default to environment
	  variable $BROKEN_LINKER (request by Jeffrey C Honig).
	+ change key_names[] array to static since it is not part of the curses
	  interface (reported by Jeffrey C Honig <jch@bsdi.com>).

990110
	+ add Tera Term terminfo entry - TD

990109
	+ reviewed/corrected macros in curses.h as per XSI document.
	+ provide support for termcap PC variable by copying it from terminfo
	  data and using it as the padding character in tputs (reported by
	  Alexander Lukyanov).
	+ corrected iris-ansi and iris-ansi-ap terminfo entries for kent and
	  kf9-kf12 capabilities, as well as adding kcbt.
	+ document the mouse handling mechanism in menu_driver and make a small
	  change in menu_driver's return codes to provide more consistency
	  (patch by Juergen Pfeifer).
	+ add fallback definition for NCURSES_CONST to termcap.h.in (reported
	  by Uchiyama Yasushi <uch@nop.or.jp>).
	+ move lib_restart.c to ncurses/base, since it uses curses functions
	  directly, and therefore cannot be used in libtinfo.so
	+ rename micro_char_size to micro_col_size, adding #define to retain
	  old name.
	+ add set_a_attributes and set_pglen_inch to terminfo structure, as per
	  XSI and Solaris 2.5.
	+ minor makefile files to build ncurses test_progs
	+ update html files in misc directory to reflect changes since 4.2

990102
	+ disable scroll hints when hashmap is enabled (patch by Alexander
	  Lukyanov).
	+ move logic for tic's verify of -e option versus -I and -C so that the
	  terminfo data is not processed if we cannot handle -e (reported by
	  Steven Schwartz <steves@unitrends.com>.
	+ add test-driver traces to terminfo and termcap functions.
	+ provide support for termcap ospeed variable by copying it from the
	  internal cur_term member, and using ospeed as the baudrate reference
	  for the delay_output and tputs functions.  If an application does not
	  set ospeed, the library behaves as before, except that _nc_timed_wait
	  is no longer used, or needed, since ospeed always has a value.  But
	  the application can modify ospeed to adjust the output of padding
	  characters (from a bug report for screen 3.7.6 and email from Michael
	  Schroeder <Michael.Schroeder@informatik.uni-erlangen.de>).
	+ removed some unused ifdef's as part of Alexander's restructuring.
	+ reviewed/updated curses.h, term.h against X/Open Curses Issue 4
	  Version 2.  This includes making some parameters NCURSES_CONST
	  rather than const, e.g., in termcap.h.
	+ change linux terminfo entry to use ncv#2, since underline does not
	  work with color

981226
	+ miscellaneous corrections for curses.h to match XSI.
	+ change --enable-no-padding configure option to be normally enabled.
	+ add section to ncurses manpage for environment variables.
	+ investigated Debian bug report that pertains to screen 3.7.4/3.7.6
	  changes, found no sign of problems on Linux (or on SunOS, Solaris)
	  running screen built with ncurses.
	+ check if tmp_fp is opened in tic.c before closing it (patch by Pavel
	  Roskin <pavel_roskin@geocities.com>).
	+ correct several font specification typos in man-pages.

981220
	+ correct default value for BUILD_CC (reported by Larry Virden).

981219
	+ modify _nc_set_writedir() to set a flag in _nc_tic_dir() to prevent
	  it from changing the terminfo directory after chdir'ing to it.
	  Otherwise, a relative path in $TERMINFO would confuse tic (from a
	  Debian bug report).
	+ correct/update ncsa terminfo entry (report by Larry Virden).
	+ update xterm-xfree86 terminfo to current (patch 90), smcur/rmcur changes
	+ add Mathew Vernon's mach console entries to terminfo.src
	+ more changes, moving functions, as part of Alexander's restructuring.
	+ modify configure script for GNU/Hurd share-library support, introduce
	  BUILD_CC variable for cross compiling (patch by Uchiyama Yasushi
	  <uch@nop.or.jp>)

981212
	+ add environment variable NCURSES_NO_SETBUF to allow disabling the
	  setbuf feature, for testing purposes.
	+ correct ifdef's for termcap.h versus term.h that suppress redundant
	  declarations of prototypes (reported by H.J.Lu).
	+ modify Makefile.os2 to add linker flags which allow multiple copies
	  of an application to coexist (reported by Ilya Zakharevich).
	+ update Makefile.glibc and associated configure script so that ncurses
	  builds as a glibc add-on with the new directory configuration
	  (reported by H.J.Lu).

981205
	+ modify gen_reps() function in gen.c to work properly on SunOS
	  (sparc), which is a left-to-right architecture.
	+ modify relative_move and tputs to avoid an interaction with the
	  BSD-style padding.  The relative_move function could produce a string
	  to replace on the screen which began with a numeric character, which
	  was then interpreted by tputs as padding.  Now relative_move will not
	  generate a string with a leading digit in that case (overwrite).
	  Also, tputs will only interpret padding if the string begins with a
	  digit; as coded it permitted a string to begin with a decimal point
	  or asterisk (reported by Larry Virden).
	> patches by Juergen Pfeifer:
	+ fix a typo in m_driver.c mouse handling and improves the error
	  handling.
	+ fix broken mouse handling in the Ada95 binding
	+ make the Ada95 sample application menus work with the new menu mouse
	  support
	+ improve the mouse handling introduced by Ilya; it now handles menus
	  with spacing.
	+ repair a minor bug in the menu_driver code discovered during this
	  rework.
	+ add new function wmouse_trafo() to hide implementation details of
	  _yoffset member of WINDOW struct needed for mouse coordinate
	  transformation.

981128
	+ modify Ada95/gen/gen.c to avoid using return-value of sprintf, since
	  some older implementations (e.g., SunOS 4.x) return the buffer
	  address rather than its length.
	> patch by Rick Ohnemus:
	+ modify demo.cc to get it to compile with newer versions of egcs.
	+ trim a space that appears at the end of the table preprocessor lines
	  ('\" t).  This space prevents some versions of man from displaying
	  the pages - changed to remove all trailing whitespace (TD)
	+ finally, 'make clean' does not remove panel objects.
	> patches by Ilya Zakharevich:
	+ allow remapping of OS/2 mouse buttons using environment variable
	  MOUSE_BUTTONS_123 with the default value 132.
	+ add mouse support to ncurses menus.

981121
	+ modify misc/makedef.cmd to report old-style .def file symbols, and to
	  generate the .def files sorted by increasing names rather than the
	  reverse.
	+ add misc/*.ref which are J.J.G.Ripoll's dll definition files (renamed
	  from misc/*.old), and updated based on the entrypoint coding he used
	  for an older version of ncurses.
	+ add README.emx, to document how to build on OS/2 EMX.
	+ updates for config.guess, config.sub from Lynx
	> patches by Ilya Zakharevich:
	+ minor fixes for mouse handling mode:
	  a) Do not initialize mouse if the request is to have no mouse;
	  b) Allow switching of OS/2 VIO mouse on and off.
	+ modify Makefile.os2 to support alternative means of generating
	  configure script, by translating Unix script with Perl.
	> patches by Juergen Pfeifer:
	+ Updates MANIFEST to reflect changes in source structure
	+ Eliminates a problem introduced with my last patch for the C++
	  binding in the panels code.  It removes the update() call done in the
	  panel destructor.
	+ Changes in the Ada95 binding to better support systems where
	  sizeof(chtype)!=sizeof(int) (e.g.  DEC Alpha).

981114
	+ modify install-script for manpages to skip over .orig and .rej files
	  (request by Larry Virden).
	> patches/discussion by Alexander Lukyanov:
	+ move base-library sources into ncurses/base and tty (serial terminal)
	  sources into ncurses/tty, as part of Alexander Lukyanov's proposed
	  changes to ncurses library.
	+ copy _tracemouse() into ncurses.c so that lib_tracemse.c need not
	  be linked into the normal ncurses library.
	+ move macro winch to a function, to hide details of struct ldat
	> patches by Juergen Pfeifer:
	+ fix a potential compile problem in cursesw.cc
	+ some Ada95 cosmetics
	+ fix a gen.c problem when compiling on 64-Bit machines
	+ fix Ada95/gen/Makefile.in "-L" linker switch
	+ modify Ada95 makefiles to use the INSTALL_PREFIX setting.

981107
	+ ifdef'd out lib_freeall.c when not configured.
	+ rename _tracebits() to _nc_tracebits().
	+ move terminfo-library sources into ncurses/tinfo, and trace-support
	  functions into ncurses/trace as part of Alexander Lukyanov's proposed
	  changes to ncurses library.
	+ modify generated term.h to always specify its own definitions for
	  HAVE_TERMIOS_H, etc., to guard against inclusion by programs with
	  broken configure scripts.

981031
	+ modify terminfo parsing to accept octal and hexadecimal constants,
	  like Solaris.
	+ remove an autoconf 2.10 artifact from the configure script's check
	  for "-g" compiler options.  (Though harmless, this confused someone
	  at Debian, who recently issued a patch that results in the opposite
	  effect).
	+ add configure option --with-ada-compiler to accommodate installations
	  that do not use gcc as the driver for GNAT (patch by Juergen
	  Pfeifer).

981017
	+ ensure ./man exists in configure script, needed when configuring
	  with --srcdir option.
	+ modify infocmp "-r" option to remove limit on formatted termcap
	  output, which makes it more like Solaris' version.
	+ modify captoinfo to treat no-argument case more like Solaris' version,
	  which uses the contents of $TERMCAP as the entry to format.
	+ modify mk-2nd.awk to handle subdirectories, e.g., ncurses/tty
	  (patch by Alexander V Lukyanov).

981010
	+ modify --with-terminfo-dirs option so that the default value is the
	  ${datadir} value, unless $TERMINFO_DIRS is already set.  This gets
	  rid of a hardcoded list of candidate directories in the configure
	  script.
	+ add some error-checking to _nc_read_file_entry() to ensure that
	  strings are properly terminated (Todd C Miller).
	+ rename manpage file curs_scr_dmp.3x to curs_scr_dump.3x, to
	  correspond with contents (reported by Neil Zanella
	  <nzanella@cs.mun.ca>).
	+ remove redundant configure check for C++ which did not work when $CXX
	  was specified with a full pathname (reported by Andreas Jaeger).
	+ corrected bcopy/memmove check; the macro was not standalone.

981003
	+ remove unnecessary portion of OS/2 EMX mouse change from
	  check_pending() (reported by Alexander V Lukyanov).

980926
	+ implement mouse support for OS/2 EMX (adapted from patch against
	  4.2(?) by Ilya Zakharevich).
	+ add configure-check for bcopy/memmove, for 980919 changes to hashmap.
	+ merge Data General terminfo from Hasufin <hasufin@vidnet.net> - TD
	+ merge AIX 3.2.5 terminfo descriptions for IBM terminals, replaces
	  some older entries - TD
	+ modify tic to compile into %'char' form in preference to %{number},
	  since that is a little more efficient.
	+ minor correction to infocmp to avoid displaying "difference" between
	  two capabilities that are rendered in equivalent forms.
	+ add -g option to tic/infocmp to force character constants to be
	  displayed in quoted form.  Otherwise their decimal values are shown.
	+ modify setupterm so that cancelled strings are treated the same as
	  absent strings, cancelled and absent booleans false (does not affect
	  tic, infocmp).
	+ modify tic, infocmp to discard redundant i3, r3 strings when output
	  to termcap format.
	> patch by Alexander V Lukyanov:
	+ improve performance of tparm, now it takes 19% instead of 25% when
	  profiling worm.
	+ rename maxlen/minlen to prec/width for better readability.
	+ use format string for printing strings.
	+ use len argument correctly in save_text, and pass it to save_number.

980919
	+ make test_progs compile (but hashmap does not function).
	+ correct NC_BUFFERED macro, used in lib_mvcur test-driver, modify
	  associated logic to avoid freeing the SP->_setbuf data.
	+ add modules home_terminfo and getenv_num to libtinfo.
	+ move write_entry to libtinfo, to work with termcap caching.
	+ minor fixes to blue.c to build with atac.
	+ remove softscroll.c module; no longer needed for testing.
	> patches by Todd C Miller:
	+ use strtol(3) instead of atoi(3) when parsing env variables so we can
	  detect a bogus (non-numeric) value.
	+ check for terminal names > MAX_NAME_SIZE in a few more places when
	  dealing with env variables again.
	+ fix a MAX_NAME_SIZE that should be MAX_NAME_SIZE+1
	+ use sizeof instead of strlen(3) on PRIVATE_INFO since it is a fixed
	  string #define (compile time vs runtime).
	+ when setting errno to ENOMEM, set it right before the return, not
	  before code that could, possibly, set errno to a different value.
	> patches by Alexander V Lukyanov:
	+ use default background in update_cost_from_blank()
	+ disable scroll-hints when hashmap is configured.
	+ improve integration of hashmap scrolling code, by adding oldhash and
	  newhash data to SP struct.
	+ invoke del_curterm from delscreen.
	+ modify del_curterm to set cur_term to null if it matches the function's
	  parameter which is deleted.
	+ modify lib_doupdate to prefer parm_ich to the enter_insert_mode and
	  exit_insert_mode combination, adjusting InsCharCost to check
	  enter_insert_mode, exit_insert_mode and insert_padding.  Add
	  insert_padding in insert mode after each char.  This adds new costs
	  to the SP struct.

980912
	+ modify test-driver in lib_mvcur.s to use _nc_setbuffer, for consistent
	  treatment.
	+ modify ncurses to restore output to unbuffered on endwin, and resume
	  buffering in refresh (see lib_set_term.c and NC_BUFFERED macro).
	+ corrected HTML version numbers (according to the W3C validator, they
	  never were HTML 2.0-compliant, but are acceptable 3.0).

980905
	+ modify MKterminfo.sh to generate terminfo.5 with tables sorted by
	  capability name, as in SVr4.
	+ modified term.h, termcap.h headers to avoid redundant declarations.
	+ change 'u_int' type in tset.c to unsigned, making this compile on
	  Sequent PRX 4.1 (reported by Michael Sterrett <msterret@coat.com>).

980829
	+ corrections to mailing addresses, and moving the magic line that
	  causes the man program to invoke tbl to the first line of each
	  manpage (patch by Rick Ohnemus <rick@ecompcon.com>).
	+ add Makefile.os2 and supporting scripts to generate dll's on OS/2 EMX
	  (from J.J.G.Ripoll, with further integration by TD).
	+ correct a typo in icl6404 terminfo entry.
	+ add xtermm and xtermc terminfo entries.
	> from esr's terminfo version:
	+ Added Francesco Potorti's tuned Wyse 99 entries.
	+ dtterm enacs correction from Alexander V Lukyanov.
	+ Add ncsa-ns, ncsa-m-ns and ncsa-m entries from esr version.

980822
	+ document AT&T acs characters in terminfo.5 manpage.
	+ use EMX _scrsize() function if terminfo and environment do not
	  declare the screen size (reported by Ilya Zakharevich
	  <ilya@math.ohio-state.edu>).
	+ remove spurious '\' characters from eterm and osborne terminfo
	  entries (prompted by an old Debian bug report).
	+ correct reversed malloc/realloc calls in _nc_doalloc (reported by
	  Hans-Joachim Widmaier <hjwidmai@foxboro.com>).
	+ correct misplaced parenthesis which caused file-descriptor from
	  opening termcap to be lost, from 980725 changes (reported by Andreas
	  Jaeger).

980815
	+ modify lib_setup.c to eliminate unneeded include of <sys/ioctl.h> when
	  termios is not used (patch by Todd C Miller).
	+ add function _nc_doalloc, to ensure that failed realloc calls do not
	  leak memory (reported by Todd C Miller).
	+ improved ncsa-telnet terminfo entry.

980809
	+ correct missing braces around a trace statement in read_entry.c,
	  from 980808 (reported by Kim DeVaughn <kimdv@best.com> and Liviu
	  Daia).

980808
	+ fix missing include <errno.h> in ditto.c (reported by Bernhard
	  Rosenkraenzer <bero@k5.sucks.eu.org>)
	+ add NCSA telnet terminfo entries from Francesco Potorti
	  <F.Potorti@cnuce.cnr.it>, from Debian bug reports.
	+ make handling of $LINES and $COLUMNS variables more compatible with
	  Solaris by allowing them to individually override the window size
	  as obtained via ioctl.

980801
	+ modify lib_vidattr.c to allow for terminal types (e.g., xterm-color)
	  which may reset all attributes in the 'op' capability, so that colors
	  are set before turning on bold and other attributes, but still after
	  turning attributes off.
	+ add 'ditto.c' to test directory to illustrate use of newterm for
	  initializing multiple screens.
	+ modify _nc_write_entry() to recover from failed attempt to link alias
	  for a terminfo on a filesystem which does not preserve character case
	  (reported by Peter L Jordan <PJordan@chla.usc.edu>).

980725
	+ updated versions of config.guess and config.sub based on automake 1.3
	+ change name-comparisons in lib_termcap to compare no more than 2
	  characters (gleaned from Debian distribution of 1.9.9g-8.8, verified
	  with Solaris curses).
	+ fix typo in curs_insstr.3x (patch by Todd C Miller)
	+ use 'access()' to check if ncurses library should be permitted to
	  open or modify files with fopen/open/link/unlink/remove calls, in
	  case the calling application is running in setuid mode (request by
	  Cristian Gafton <gafton@redhat.com>, responding to Duncan Simpson
	  <dps@io.stargate.co.uk>).
	+ arm100 terminfo entries from Dave Millen <dmill@globalnet.co.uk>).
	+ qnxt2 and minitel terminfo entries from esr's version.

980718
	+ use -R option with ldconfig on FreeBSD because otherwise it resets
	  the search path to /usr/lib (reported by Dan Nelson).
	+ add -soname option when building shared libraries on OpenBSD 2.x
	  (request by QingLong).
	+ add configure options --with-manpage-format and --with-manpage-renames
	  (request by QingLong).
	+ correct conversion of CANCELLED_NUMERIC in write_object(), which was
	  omitting the high-order byte, producing a 254 in the compiled
	  terminfo.
	+ modify return-values of tgetflag, tgetnum, tgetstr, tigetflag,
	  tigetnum and tigetstr to be compatible with Solaris (gleaned from
	  Debian distribution of 1.9.9g-8.8).
	+ modify _nc_syserr_abort to abort only when compiled for debugging,
	  otherwise simply exit with an error.

980711
	+ modify Ada95 'gen' program to use appropriate library suffix (e.g.,
	  "_g" for a debug build).
	+ update Ada95 'make clean' rule to include generics .ali files
	+ add a configure test to ensure that if GNAT is found, that it can
	  compile/link working Ada95 program.
	+ flush output in beep and flash functions, fixing a problem with
	  getstr (patch by Alexander V Lukyanov)
	+ fix egcs 1.0.2 warning for etip.h (patch by Chris Johns).
	+ correct ifdef/brace nesting in lib_sprintf.c (patch by Bernhard
	  Rosenkraenzer <bero@Pool.Informatik.RWTH-Aachen.DE>).
	+ correct typo in wattr_get macro from 980509 fixes (patch by Dan
	  Nelson).

980704
	+ merge changes from current XFree86 xterm terminfo descriptions.
	+ add configure option '--without-ada'.
	+ add a smart-default for termcap 'ac' to terminfo 'acs_chars' which
	  corresponds to vt100.
	+ change translation for termcap 'rs' to terminfo 'rs2', which is
	  the documented equivalent, rather than 'rs1'.

980627
	+ slow 'worm' down a little, for very fast machines.
	+ corrected firstchar/lastchar computation in lib_hline.c
	+ simplify some expressions with CHANGED_CELL, CHANGED_RANGE and
	  CHANGED_TO_EOL macros.
	+ modify init_pair so that if a color-pair is reinitialized, we will
	  repaint the areas of the screen whose color changes, like SVr4 curses
	  (reported by Christian Maurer <maurer@inf.fu-berlin.de>).
	+ modify getsyx/setsyx macros to comply with SVr4 man-page which
	  says that leaveok() affects their behavior (report by Darryl Miles,
	  patch by Alexander V Lukyanov).

980620
	+ review terminfo.5 against Solaris 2.6 curses version, corrected
	  several minor errors/omissions.
	+ implement tparm %l format.
	+ implement tparm printf-style width and precision for %s, %d, %x, %o
	  as per XSI.
	+ implement tparm dynamic variables (reported by Xiaodan Tang).

980613
	+ update man-page for for wattr_set, wattr_get (cf:  980509)
	+ correct limits in hashtest, which would cause nonprinting characters
	  to be written to large screens.
	+ correct configure script, when --without-cxx was specified:  the
	  wrong variable was used for cf_cv_type_of_bool.  Compilers up to gcc
	  2.8 tolerated the missing 'int'.
	+ remove the hardcoded name "gcc" for the GNU Ada compiler.  The
	  compiler's name might be something like "egcs" (patch by Juergen
	  Pfeifer).
	+ correct curs_addch.3x, which implied that echochar could directly
	  display control characters (patch by Alexander V Lukyanov).
	+ fix typos in ncurses-intro.html (patch by Sidik Isani
	  <isani@cfht.hawaii.edu>)

980606
	+ add configure test for conflicting use of exception in math.h and
	  other headers.
	+ minor optimization to 'hash()' function in hashmap.c, reduces its
	  time by 10%.
	+ correct form of LD_SHARED_OPTS for HP-UX 10.x (patch by Tim Mooney).
	+ fix missing quotes for 'print' in MKunctrl.awk script (reported by
	  Mihai Budiu <mihaib@gs41.sp.cs.cmu.edu>).
	> patch by Alexander V Lukyanov:
	+ correct problem on Solaris (with poll() function) where getch could
	  hang indefinitely even if timeout(x) was called.  This turned out to
	  be because milliseconds was not updated before 'goto retry' in
	  _nc_timed_wait.
	+ simplified the function _nc_timed_wait and fixed another bug, which
	  was the assumption of !GOOD_SELECT && HAVE_GETTIMEOFDAY in *timeleft
	  assignment.
	+ removed the cycle on EINTR, as it seems to be useless.

980530
	+ add makefile-rule for test/keynames
	+ modify run_tic.sh and shlib to ensure that user's .profile does not
	  override the $PATH used to run tic (patch by Tim Mooney).
	+ restore LD_SHARED_OPTS to $(LD_SHARED_FLAGS) when linking programs,
	  needed for HP-UX shared-library path (recommended by Tim Mooney).
	+ remove special case of HP-UX -L options, use +b options to embed
	  $(libdir) in the shared libraries (recommended by Tim Mooney).
	+ add checks for some possible buffer overflows and unchecked
	  malloc/realloc/calloc/strdup return values (patch by Todd C Miller
	  <Todd.Miller@courtesan.com>)

980523
	+ correct maxx/maxy expression for num_columns/num_lines in derwin
	  (patch by Alexander V Lukyanov).
	+ add /usr/share/lib/terminfo and /usr/lib/terminfo as compatibilty
	  fallbacks to _nc_read_entry(), along with --with-terminfo-dirs
	  configure option (suggested by Mike Hopkirk).
	+ modify config.guess to recognize Unixware 2.1 and 7 (patch by Mike
	  Hopkirk <hops@sco.com>).
	+ suppress definition of CC_SHARED_OPTS in LDFLAGS_SHARED in c++
	  Makefile.in, since this conflicts when g++ is used with HP-UX
	  compiler (reported by Tim Mooney).
	+ parenthesize 'strcpy' calls in c++ binding to workaround redefinition
	  in some C++ implementations (reported by several people running
	  egcs with glibc 2.0.93, analysis by Andreas Jaeger.

980516
	+ modify write_entry.c so that it will not attempt to link aliases
	  with embedded '/', but give only a warning.
	+ put -L$(libdir) first when linking programs, except for HP-UX.
	+ modify comp_scan.c to handle SVr4 terminfo description for att477,
	  which contains a colon in the description field.
	+ modify configure script to support SCO osr5.0.5 shared libraries
	  (from comp.unix.sco.programmer newsgroup item by Mike Hopkirk
	  <hops@sco.com>).
	+ eliminate extra GoTo call in lib_doupdate.c (patch by Alexander V.
	  Lukyanov).
	+ minor adjustments of const/NCURSES_CONST from IRIX compile.
	+ add updates based on esr's 980509 version of terminfo.src.

980509
	+ correct macros for wattr_set, wattr_get, separate wattrset macro from
	  these to preserve behavior that allows attributes to be combined with
	  color pair numbers.
	+ add configure option --enable-no-padding, to allow environment
	  variable $NCURSES_NO_PADDING to eliminate non-mandatory padding,
	  thereby making terminal emulators (e.g., for vt100) a little more
	  efficient (request by Daniel Eisenbud <eisenbud@cs.swarthmore.edu>).
	+ modify configure script to embed ABI in shared libraries for HP-UX
	  10.x (detailed request by Tim Mooney).
	+ add test/example of the 'filter()' function.
	+ add nxterm and xterm-color terminfo description (request by Cristian
	  Gafton <gafton@redhat.com>).
	+ modify rxvt terminfo description to clear alternate screen before
	  switching back to normal screen, for compatibility with applications
	  which use xterm (reported by Manoj Kasichainula <manojk@io.com>).
	+ modify linux terminfo description to reset color palette (reported
	  by Telford Tendys <telford@eng.uts.edu.au>).
	+ correction to doupdate, for case where terminal does not support
	  insert/delete character.  The logic did not check that there was a
	  difference in alignment of changes to old/new screens before
	  repainting the whole non-blank portion of the line.  Modified to fall
	  through into logic that reduces by the portion which does not differ
	  (reported by Daniel Eisenbud <eisenbud@cs.swarthmore.edu>).
	+ minor performance improvement to wnoutrefresh by moving some
	  comparisons out of inner loop.

980425
	+ modify configure script to substitute NCURSES_CONST in curses.h
	+ updated terminfo entries for xterm-xf86-v40, xterm-16color,
	  xterm-8bit to correspond to XFree86 3.9Ag.
	+ remove restriction that forces ncurses to use setaf/setab if the
	  number of colors is greater than 8.  (see 970524 for xterm-16color).
	+ change order of -L options (so that $(libdir) is searched first) when
	  linking tic and other programs, to workaround HP's linker.
	  Otherwise, the -L../lib is embedded when linking against shared
	  libraries and the installed program does not run (reported by Ralf
	  Hildebrandt).
	+ modify configuration of shared libraries on Digital Unix so that
	  versioning is embedded in the library, rather than implied by
	  links (patch by Tim Mooney).

980418
	+ modify etip.h to avoid conflict with math.h on HP-UX 9.03 with gcc
	  2.8.1 which redefines 'exception' (reported by Ralf Hildebrandt
	  <R.Hildebrandt@tu-bs.de>).
	+ correct configure tests in CF_SHARED_OPTS which used $CC value to
	  check for gcc, rather than autoconf's $GCC value.  This did not
	  work properly if the full pathname of the compiler were given
	  (reported by Michael Yount <yount@csf.Colorado.edu>).
	+ revise check for compiler options to force ANSI mode since repeating
	  an option such as -Aa causes HP's compiler to fail on its own headers
	  (reported by Clint Olsen <olsenc@ichips.intel.com>).

980411
	+ ifdef'd has_key() and mcprint() as extended functions.
	+ modified several prototypes to correspond with 1997 version of
	  X/Open Curses (affects ABI since developers have used attr_get).
	+ remove spurious trailing blanks in glibc addon-scripts (patch by
	  H.J.Lu).
	+ insert a few braces at locations where gcc-2.8.x asks to use them to
	  avoid ambigous else's, use -fpic rather than -fPIC for Linux (patch
	  by Juergen Pfeifer).

980404
	+ split SHLIB_LIST into SHLIB_DIRS/SHLIB_LIST to keep -L options
	  before -l to accommodate Solaris' linker (reported by Larry Virden).

980328
	+ modify lib_color.c to eliminate dependency on orig_colors and
	  orig_pair, since SVr4 curses does not require these either, but
	  uses them when they are available.
	+ add detailed usage-message to infocmp.
	+ correct a typo in att6386 entry (a "%?" which was "?").
	+ add -f option to infocmp and tic, which formats the terminfo
	  if/then/else/endif so that they are readable (with newlines and
	  tabs).
	+ fixes for glibc addon scripts (patch by H.J.Lu).

980321
	+ revise configure macro CF_SPEED_TYPE so that termcap.h has speed_t
	  declared (from Adam J. Richter <adam@yggdrasil.com>)
	+ remove spurious curs_set() call from leaveok() (J.T.Conklin).
	+ corrected handling leaveok() in doupdate() (patch by Alexander V.
	  Lukyanov).
	+ improved version of wredrawln (patch by Alexander V. Lukyanov).
	+ correct c++/Makefile.in so install target do not have embedded ../lib
	  to confuse it (patch by Thomas Graf <graf@essi.fr>).
	+ add warning to preinstall rule which checks if the installer would
	  overwrite a curses.h or termcap.h that is not derived from ncurses.
	  (The recommended configuration for developers who need both is to
	  use --disable-overwrite).
	+ modify preinstall rule in top-level Makefile to avoid implicit
	  use of 'sh', to accommodate Ultrix 4.4 (reported by Joao Palhoto
	  Matos <jmatos@math.ist.utl.pt>, patch by Thomas Esser
	  <te@informatik.uni-hannover.de>)
	+ refine ifdef's for TRACE so that libncurses has fewer dependencies
	  on libtinfo when TRACE is disabled.
	+ modify configure script so that if the --with-termlib option is used
	  to generate a separate terminfo library, we chain it to the ncurses
	  library with a "-l" option (reported by Darryl Miles and Ian T.
	  Zimmerman).

980314
	+ correct limits and window in wredrawln function (reported/analysis by
	  Alexander V. Lukyanov).
	+ correct sed expression in configure script for --with-fallback
	  option (patch by Jesse Thilo).
	+ correct some places in configure script where $enableval was used
	  rather than $withval (patch by Darryl Miles <dlm@g7led.demon.co.uk>).
	+ modify some man-pages so no '.' or '..' falls between TH and SH
	  macros, to accommodate man_db program (reported by Ian T. Zimmerman
	  <itz@rahul.net>).
	+ terminfo.src 10.2.1 from Eric's webpage.
	> several changes by Juergen Pfeifer:
	+ add copyright notices (and rcs id's) on remaining man-pages.
	+ corrected prototypes for slk_* functions, using chtype rather than
	  attr_t.
	+ implemented the wcolor_set() and slk_color() functions
	+ the slk_attr_{set,off,on} functions need an additional void*
	  parameter according to XSI.
	+ fix the C++ and Ada95 binding as well as the man pages to
	  reflect above enhancements.

980307
	+ use 'stat()' rather than 'access()' in toe.c to check for the
	  existence of $HOME/.terminfo, since it may be a file.
	+ suppress configure CF_CXX_LIBRARY check if we are not using g++
	  2.7.x, since this is not needed with g++ 2.8 or egcs (patch by
	  Juergen Pfeifer).
	+ turn on hashmap scrolling code by default, intend to remedy defects
	  by 4.3 release.
	+ minor corrections to terminfo.src changelog.

980302	4.2 release for upload to prep.ai.mit.edu
	+ correct Florian's email address in ncurses-intro.html
	+ terminfo.src 10.2.0 from Eric.

980228	pre-release
	+ add linux-koi8r replace linux-koi8, which is not KOI8 (patch by
	  QingLong <qinglong@Bolizm.ihep.su>).
	+ minor documentation fixes (patch by Juergen Pfeifer).
	+ add setlocale() call to ncurses.c (reported by Claes G. Lindblad
	  <claesg@algonet.se>).
	+ correct sign-extension in lib_insstr.c (reported by Sotiris
	  Vassilopoulos <svas@leon.nrcps.ariadne-t.gr>)

	+ regenerated some documentation overlooked in 980214 patch
	  (ncurses-intro.doc, curs_outopts.3x.html)
	+ minor ifdef change to C++ binding to work with gcc 2.8.0 (patch by
	  Juergen Pfeifer).
	+ change maintainer's mailing address to florian@gnu.org, change
	  tentative mailing list address to bug-ncurses-request@gnu.org (patch
	  by Florian La Roche).
	+ add definition of $(REL_VERSION) to c++/Makefile.in (reported by Gran
	  Hasse <gh@raditex.se>).
	+ restore version numbers to Ada95 binding, accidentally deleted by
	  copyright patch (patch by Juergen Pfeifer).

980214	pre-release
	+ remove ncurses.lsm from MANIFEST so that it won't be used in FSF
	  distributions, though it is retained in development.
	+ correct scaling of milliseconds to nanoseconds in lib_napms.c (patch
	  by Jeremy Buhler).
	+ update mailing-list information (bug-ncurses@gnu.org).
	+ update announcement for upcoming 4.2 release.
	+ modify -lm test to check for 'sin()' rather than 'floor()'
	+ remove spurious commas from terminfo.src descriptions.
	+ change copyright notices to Free Software Foundation

980207
	+ minor fixes for autoconf macros CF_ERRNO, CF_HELP_MESSAGE and
	  CF_SIZECHANGE
	+ modify Makefile.glibc so that $(objpfx) is defined (H.J.Lu).
	+ ifdef-out true-return from _nc_mouse_inline() which depends on
	  merge of QNX patch (pending 4.2 release).
	> patch by J.T.Conklin, to split off seldom-used modules in ncurses
	  (reduces size by up to 2.6kb):

	  for nanosleep().
	+ moved wchgat() from lib_addch.c to lib_chgat.c
	+ moved clearok(), immedok(), leaveok(), and scrollok() from

	  is not available.
	+ include <sys/types.h> in CF_SYS_TIME_SELECT to work with FreeBSD 2.1.5
	+ add ncv capability to FreeBSD console (cons25w), making reverse
	  work with color.
	+ correct sense of configure-test for sys/time.h inclusion with
	  sys/select.h
	+ fixes for Ada95/ada_include/Makefile.in to work with --srcdir option.
	+ remove unused/obsolete test-program rules from progs/Makefile.in
	  (the rules in ncurses/Makefile.in work).
	+ remove shared-library loader flags from test/Makefile.in, etc.
	+ simplify test/configure.in using new version of autoconf to create
	  test/ncurses_cfg.h
	+ suppress suffix rules in test/Makefile.in, provide explicit dependency
	  to work with --srcdir option and less capable 'make' programs.
	> adapted from patch for QNX by Xiaodan Tang:
	+ initialize %P and %g variables set/used in tparm, and also ensure
	  that empty strings don't return a null result from tparam_internal
	+ add QNX-specific prototype for vsscanf()
	+ move initialization of SP->_keytry from init_keytry() to newterm() to
	  avoid resetting it via a keyok() call by mouse_activate().
	+ reorganized some functions in lib_mouse() to use case-statements.
	+ remove sgr string from qnx terminfo entry since it is reported to
	  turn off attributes inconsistently.

980124
	+ add f/F/b/B commands to ncurses 'b' test to toggle colors, providing

	+ adjusted emx.src to use no_color_video, now works with ncurses 'b'
	  and 'k' tests.
	+ implement no_color_video attribute, and as a special case, reverse
	  colors when the reverse attribute cannot be combined with color.

	  <brett@xylan.com>).
	> from reports by Fred Fish:
	+ add configure-test for isascii
	+ add configure-test for -lm library.
	+ modify CF_BOOL_SIZE to check if C++ bool types are unsigned.
	> patches by J.J.G.Ripoll
	+ add configure/makefile variables to support .exe extension on
	  OS/2 EMX (requires additional autoconf patches).
	+ explicitly initialize variables in lib_data.c to appease OS/2 linker
	> patches by Fred Fish <fnf@ninemoons.com>
	+ misc/Makefile.in (install.data):  Avoid trying to install the CVS
	  directory.
	+ aclocal.m4 (install.includes):  Remove files in the include directory
	  where we are going to install new ones, not the original source
	  files.
	+ misc/terminfo.src:  Add entry for "beterm", derived from termcap
	  distributed with BeOS PR2 using captoinfo.
	+ aclocal.m4: Wrap $cf_cv_type_of_bool with quotes (contains space)
	+ aclocal.m4: Assume bool types are unsigned.
	+ progs/infocmp.c: workaround mwcc 32k function data limit

980117
	+ correct initialization of color-pair (from 970524) in xmas.c, which
	  was using only one color-pair for all colors (reported by
	  J.J.G.Ripoll).
	+ add multithread options for objects build on EMX, for compatibility
	  with XFree86.
	+ split up an expression in MKlib_gen.sh to work around a problem on
	  OS/2 EMX, with 'ash' (patch by J.J.G.Ripoll).
	+ change terminfo entries xterm (xterm-xf86-v40), xterm-8bit rs1 to use

	+ correct typo in panel/Makefile.in, reversed if-statement in scrolling
	  optimization (Alexander V.  Lukyanov).
	+ test for 'remove()', use 'unlink() if not found (patch by Philippe De
	  Muyter <phdm@macqel.be>).
	> patches by Juergen Pfeifer:
	+ Improve a feature of the forms driver.  For invisible fields
	  (O_VISIBLE off) only the contents but not the attributes are cleared.
	  We now clear both.  (Reported by Javier Kohan
	  <jkohan@adan.fceia.unr.edu.ar>)
	+ The man page form_field_opts.3x makes now clear, that invisible
	  fields are also always inactive.
	+ adjust ifdef's to compile the C++ binding with the just released
	  gcc-2.8.0 c++ and the corresponding new C++ libraries.

980110
	+ correct "?" command in ncurses.c; it was performing non-screen writes
	  while the program was in screen mode.  (It "worked" in 1.9.9e because
	  that version sets OPOST and OCRNL incorrectly).
	+ return error from functions in lib_kernel, lib_raw and lib_ti if
	  cur_term is null, or if underlying I/O fails.
	+ amend change to tputs() so that it does not return an error if
	  cur_term is null, since some applications depend on being able to use
	  tputs without initializing the terminal (reported by Christian J.
	  Robinson <infynity@cyberhighway.net>).

980103
	+ add a copy of emx.src from J.J.G.Ripoll's OS/2 EMX version of ncurses
	  1.9.9e, together with fixes/additions for the "ansi" terminal type.
	+ add tic check for save/restore cursor if change_scroll_region is
	  defined (from O'Reilly book).
	+ modify read_termcap.c to handle EMX-style pathnames (reported by
	  J.J.G.Ripoll).
	+ modify lib_raw.c to use EMX's setmode (from J.J.G.Ripoll, who says
	  EMX's curses does this).
	+ modify _nc_tic_expand() to generate \0 rather than \200.
	+ move/revise 'expand()' from dump_entry.c to ncurses library as
	  _nc_tic_expand(), for use by tack.
	+ decode \a as \007 for terminfo, as per XSI.
	+ correct translation of terminfo "^@", to \200, like \0.
	+ modify next_char() to treat <cr><lf> the same as <newline>, for
	  cross-platform compatibility.
	+ use new version of autoconf (971230) to work around limited
	  environment on CLIX, due to the way autoconf builds --help message.
	> patch by Juergen Pfeifer:
	+ check that the Ada95 binding runs against the correct version of
	  ncurses.
	+ insert constants about the library version into the main spec-file of
	  the Ada95 binding.

971227
	+ modify open/fopen calls to use binary mode, needed for EMX.
	+ modify configure script to work with autoconf 2.10 mods for OS/2
	  EMX from J.J.G.Ripoll.
	+ generated ncurses_cfg.h with patch (971222) to autoconf 2.12 which
	  bypasses limited sed buffer length.
	> several changes from Juan Jose Garcia Ripoll <worm@arrakis.es>
	  (J.J.G.Ripoll) to support OS/2 EMX:
	+ add a _scrolling flag to SP, to set when we encounter a terminal
	  that simply cannot scroll.
	+ corrected logic in _nc_add_to_try(), by ensuring that strings with
	  embedded \200 characters are matched.
	+ don't assume the host has 'link()' function, for linking terminfo
	  entries.

971220
	+ if there's no ioctl's to support sigwinch handler, disable it.
	+ add configure option --disable-ext-funcs to remove the extended
	  functions from the build.
	+ add configure option --with-termlib to generate the terminfo
	  functions as a separate library.
	+ add 'sources' rule to facilitate cross-compiling.
	+ review/fix order of mostlyclean/clean/distclean rules.
	+ modify install-rule for headers to first remove old header, in
	  case there was a symbolic link that confuses the install script.
	+ corrected substitution for NCURSES_CONST in term.h (cf: 971108)
	+ add null pointer checks in wnoutrefresh(), overlap() (patch by
	  Xiaodan Tang <xtang@qnx.com>)
	+ correct tputs(), which could dereference a null cur_term if invoked
	  before terminal is initialized (patch by Christopher Seawood
	  <cls@seawood.org>)
	> patch by Juergen Pfeifer:
	+ makes better use of "pragma Inline" in the Ada95 binding
	+ resynchronizes the generated html manpages

971213
	+ additional fixes for man-pages section-references
	+ add (for debugging) a check for ich/ich1 conflict with smir/rmir
	  to tic, etc.
	+ remove hpa/vpa from rxvt terminal description because they are not
	  implemented correctly, added sgr0.
	+ change ncurses 's' to use raw mode, so ^Q works (reported by Rudolf
	  Leitgeb <leitgeb@leland.stanford.edu>)

971206
	+ modify protection when installing libraries to (normally) not
	  executable.  HP-UX shared libraries are an exception.
	+ add configure check for 'tack'.
	+ implement script for renaming section-references in man-page install,
	  for Debian configuration.
	+ add validity-check for SP in trace code in baudrate() (reported by
	  Daniel Weaver).
	> patch by Alexander V. Lukyanov (fixes to match sol25 curses)
	+ modify 'overlay()' so that copy applies target window background to
	  characters.
	+ correct 'mvwin()' so that it does not clear the previous locations.
	+ correct lib_acs.c so that 8-bit character is not sign expanded in
	  case of wide characters in chtype.
	+ correct control-char test in lib_addch.c for use with wide chars
	+ use attribute in the chtype when adding a control character in
	  lib_addch.c control char was added with current attribute

971129
	+ save/restore errno in _tracef() function
	+ change treatment of initialize_color to use a range of 0..1000
	  (recommended by Daniel Weaver).
	+ set umask in mkinstalldirs, fixing problems reported by users who
	  have set root's umask to 077.
	+ correct bug in tic that caused capabilities to be reprinted at the
	  end of output when they had embedded comments.
	+ rewrote wredrawln to correspond to XSI, and split-out since it is
	  not often used (from report by Alexander V. Lukyanov, 970825)
	+ rewrote Dan Nelson's change to make it portable, as well as to
	  correct logic for handling backslashes.
	+ add code to _nc_tgetent() to make it work more like a real tgetent().
	  It removes all empty fields, and removes all but the first in a group
	  of duplicate caps.  The code was pulled from the BSD libtermcap code
	  in termcap.c (patch by Dan Nelson <dnelson@emsphone.com>
	+ don't include --enable-widec in the --with-develop configure option,
	  since it is not binary-compatible with 4.1 (noted by Alexander V.
	  Lukyanov)
	> patch by Juergen Pfeifer:
	+ further improvements of the usage of elaboration pragmas in the Ada95
	  binding
	+ enhanced Ada95 sample to use the user_data mechanism for panels.
	+ a fix for the configuration script to make gnat-3.10 the required
	  version.
	+ resync of the html version of the manpages

971122
	> fixes/updates for terminfo.src:
	+ add vt220-js, pilot, rbcomm, datapoint entries from esr's 27-jun-97
	  version.
	+ add hds200 description (Walter Skorski)
	+ add EMX 0.9b descriptions
	+ correct rmso/smso capabilities in wy30-mc and wy50-mc (Daniel Weaver)
	+ rename xhpterm back to hpterm.
	> patch by Juergen Pfeifer:
	+ Improves the usage of elaboration pragmas for the Ada95 binding.
	+ Adds a translation of the test/rain.c into Ada95 to the samples.
	  This has been contributed to the project by Laurent Pautet
	  (pautet@gnat.com)

971115
	+ increase MAX_NAME_SIZE to 512 to handle extremely long alias list
	  in HP-UX terminfo.
	+ correction & simplification of delay computation in tputs, based on
	  comments from Daniel Weaver.
	+ replace test for SCO with more precise header tests.
	+ add configure test for unsigned literals, use in NCURSES_BITS macro.
	+ comment-out the -PIC, etc., flags from c++, progs and test makefiles
	  since they probably are not needed, and are less efficient (noted by.
	  Ju"rgen Fluk)
	+ add -L$(libdir) to loader options, after -L../lib so that loaders
	  that record this information will tend to do the right thing if
	  the programs are moved around after installing them (suggested by.
	  Ju"rgen Fluk).
	+ add -R option to loader options for programs for Solaris if the
	  --enable-rpath option is specified for the libraries.

971112
	+ correct installed filename for shared libraries on *BSD (reported by
	  Ju"rgen Fluk).

971108
	+ cleanup logic for deciding when tputs() should call delay_output(),
	  based on comments from Daniel Weaver.
	+ modified tputs() to avoid use of float.
	+ correct use of trailpad in tputs(), which used the wrong variable
	  in call to delay_output().
	+ correct inverted expression for null-count in delay_output()
	  (analysis by Daniel Weaver).
	+ apply --enable-rpath option to Solaris (requested by Larry Virden).
	+ correct substitution of EXTRA_CFLAGS for gcc 2.6.3
	+ correct check for error-return by _nc_tgetent(), which returns 0
	  for success.
	+ add configure test for BSD 4.4 cgetent() function, modify
	  read_termcap.c to use the host's version of that if found, using the
	  terminal database on FreeBSD (reported by Peter Wemm).
	+ add u8, u9 strings to sun-il description for Daniel Weaver.
	+ use NCURSES_CONST in panel's user-pointer.
	+ modify edit_cfg.sh and MKterm.h.awk.in to substitute NCURSES_CONST
	  so that will work on NeXT.
	+ use _nc_set_screen() rather than assignments to SP to fix port to
	  NeXT (reported by Francisco A. Tomei Torres).

971101
	+ force mandatory padding in bell and flash_screen, as specified in XSI.
	+ don't allow padding_baud_rate to override mandatory delays (reported
	  by Daniel Weaver).
	+ modify delay_output() to use _nc_timed_wait() if no baudrate has been
	  defined, or if the cur_term pointer is not initialized.  XSI treats
	  this as unspecified.  (requested by Daniel Weaver).
	+ change getcap-cache ifdef's to eliminate unnecessary chdir/mkdir
	  when that feature is not configured.
	+ remove _nc_err_abort() calls when write_entry.c finds a directory but
	  cannot write to it, e.g., when translating part/all of /etc/termcap
	  (reported by Andreas Jaeger <aj@arthur.rhein-neckar.de>).
	  (this dates back to 951102, in 1.9.7a).
	+ minor ifdef fixes to compile with atac and glibc 2.0.5c
	+ add check for -lgen when configuring regexpr.h
	+ modify Solaris shared-library option "-d y" to "-dy" to workaround
	  incompatibility of gcc 2.7.2 vs vendor's tools.

	+ correct ifdef's for struct winsize vs struct ttysize in lib_setup.c
	  to compile on SCO.
	+ remove dangling backslash in panel/Makefile.in
	+ modify MKkeyname.awk to work with SCO's nawk, which dumps core in the
	  length() function.
	+ correct length of allocation in _nc_add_to_try(), to allow for
	  trailing null.
	+ correct logic in _nc_remove_key(), which was discarding too many
	  nodes (patch by Alexander V. Lukyanov)

971025
	+ add definition for $(REL_VERSION) to test/Makefile.in, so *BSD
	  shared libraries link properly (see 970524).
	+ modify Linux shared-library generation to include library
	  dependencies (e.g., -lncurses and -lgpm) in the forms, menu and
	  panel libraries (suggested by Juergen Pfeifer).
	+ modify configure script to use config.guess and config.sub rather
	  than uname, which is unreliable on some systems.
	+ updated Makefile.glibc, test-built with glibc 2.0.5c
	+ modify keyname() to return values consistent with SVr4 curses (patch
	  by Ju"rgen Fluk).
	> changes requested by Daniel Weaver:
	+ modify delay_output() so that it uses the same output function as
	  tputs() if called from that function.
	+ move _baudrate from SCREEN to TERMINAL so that low-level use of
	  tputs works when SP is not set.
	> patch by Juergen Pfeifer:
	+ factor lib_menu and lib_form into smaller modules
	+ clean up the interface between panel and SCREEN
	+ minor changes to the Ada95 mouse support implemenation
	+ minor bugfix in C++ binding to ripoff windows
	+ fix a few Ada95 html documentation pages

971018
	+ split-out lib_ungetch.c, make runtime link to resizeterm() to
	  decouple those modules from lib_restart.c
	+ add xterm-xf86-v39t description to terminfo.src
	+ reset SP->_endwin in lib_tstp.c cleanup() function after calling
	  endwin() to avoid unnecessary repainting if the application has
	  established an atexit function, etc.  Encountered this problem in
	  the c++ demo, whose destructors repaint the screen.
	+ combine _nc_get_screensize() and resizeterm() calls as new function
	  _nc_update_screensize().
	+ minor fixes to allow compile with g++ (suggested by Nelson H. F.
	  Beebe).
	+ implement install-rules for Ada95 makefiles.
	+ use screen_lines or MAXLINES as needed where LINES was coded,
	  as well as screen_columns for COLS, in the ncurses library.

	+ modify logic for ripped-off lines to handle several SCREENs.
	> patch by Juergen Pfeifer:
	+ factors lib_slk.c into some smaller modules
	+ factors panel.c into some smaller modules
	+ puts the static information about the current panel stack into the
	  SCREEN structure to allow different panel stacks on different
	  screens.
	+ preliminary fix for an error adjusting LINES to account for
	  ripped-off lines.

971011
	+ move _nc_max_click_interval and other mouse interface items to SCREEN
	  struct so that they are associated with a single terminal, and also
	  save memory when the application does not need a mouse (roughly 3k vs
	  0.5k on Linux).
	+ modify mouseinterval() so that a negative parameter queries the
	  click-interval without modifying it.
	+ modify ncurses 'i' test to work with ncurses' apparent extension from
	  SVr4, i.e., allows nocbreak+noecho (analysis by Alexander V.
	  Lukyanov).
	+ add configure options --with-ada-includes and --with-ada-objects,
	  to drive Ada95 binding install (not yet implemented).
	+ install C++ binding as -lncurses++ and associated headers with the
	  other ncurses headers.
	+ fix header uninstall if configure --srcdir is used.
	> minor interface changes (request by Daniel Weaver <danw@znyx.com>,
	  to support 'tack' program):
	+ export functions _nc_trans_string() and _nc_msec_cost().
	+ add variable _nc_nulls_sent, to record the number of padding
	  characters output in delay_output().
	+ move tests for generic_type and hard_copy terminals in setupterm()
	  to the end of that function so that the library will still be
	  initialized, though not generally useful for curses programs.
	> patches by Alexander V. Lukyanov:
	+ modify ClrBottom() to avoid using clr_eos if there is only one line
	  to erase.
	+ typo in configure --help.
	> patch by J.T.Conklin (with minor resync against Juergen's changes)
	+ split-out lib_flash.c from lib_beep.c
	+ split-out lib_hline.c and lib_vline.c from lib_box.c
	+ split-out lib_wattron.c, lib_wattroff.c from lib_addch.c

971005
	> patch by Juergen Pfeifer:
	+ correct source/target of c++/edit_cfg.sh

971004
	+ add color, mouse support to kterm terminfo entry.
	+ modify lib_mouse.c to recognize rxvt, kterm, color_xterm also as
	  providing "xterm"-style mouse.
	+ updated rxvt's terminfo description to correspond to 2.21b, with
	  fixes for the acsc (the box1 capability is incorrect, ech1 does not
	  work).
	+ fix logic in parse_entry.c that discarded acsc when 'synthesizing'
	  an entry from equivalents in XENIX or AIX.  This lets ncurses handle
	  the distribution copy of rxvt's terminfo.
	+ modify acsc capability for linux and linux-koi8 terminfo descriptions
	  (from Pavel Roskin <pavel@absolute.spb.su>).
	+ corrected definition in curses.h for ACS_LANTERN, which was 'I'
	  rather than 'i' (see 970802).
	+ updated terminfo.src with reformatted acsc entries, and repaired the
	  trashed entries with spurious '\' characters that this exposed.
	+ add logic to dump_entry.c to reformat acsc entries into canonical
	  form (sorted, unique mapping).
	+ add configure script to generate c++/etip.h
	+ add configure --with-develop option, to enable by default most of the
	  experimental options (requested by Alexander V. Lukyanov).
	+ rename 'deinstall' to 'uninstall', following GNU convention (suggested
	  by Alexander V. Lukyanov).
	> patches by Alexander V. Lukyanov:
	+ modify tactics 2 and 5 in onscreen_mvcur(), to allow them on the last
	  line of the screen, since carriage return will not cause a newline.
	+ remove clause from PutCharLR() that would try to use
	  eat_newline_glitch since that apparently does not work on some
	  terminals (e.g., M$ telnet).
	+ correct a limit check in scroll_csr_backward()
	> patches by Juergen Pfeifer:
	+ adds dummy implementations of methods above() and below() to the
	  NCursesPanel class.
	+ fixes missing returncode in NCursesWindow::ripoffline()
	+ fixes missing returncode in TestApplication::run() in demo.cc
	+ We should at least give a comment in etip.h why it is currently a
	  problem to install the C++ binding somewhere
	+ makes the WINDOW* argument of wenclose() a const.
	+ modifies several of the routines in lib_adabind.c to use a const
	  WINDOW* argument.

970927
	+ add 'deinstall' rules.
	+ use explicit assignments in configure --without-progs option to
	  work around autoconf bug which doesn't always set $withval.
	+ check for ldconfig, don't try to run it if not found.
	+ implement simple/unoptimized case in lib_doupdate.c to handle
	  display with magic cookie glitch, tested with ncurses.c program.
	+ correct missing _tracef in getmouse(), to balance the returnCode
	  macro.
	+ simplify show_attr() in ncurses.c using termattrs().
	> patches by Juergen Pfeifer:
	+ provides missing inlines for mvw[hv]line in cursesw.h of the C++
	  binding
	+ fixes a typo in a comment of frm_driver.c
	+ Enhances Ada95 Makefiles to fulfill the requirement of GNAT-3.10 that
	  generics should be compiled.  Proper fixes to the configuration
	  scripts are also provided.

970920
	+ several modifications to the configure script (requested by Ward
	  Horner):
	  + add configure options --without-progs, to suppress the build of the
	    utility programs, e.g., for cross-compiling.
	  + add $(HOSTCCFLAGS) and $(HOSTLDFLAGS) symbols to ncurses
	    Makefile.in, to simplify setup for cross compiling.
	  + add logic in configure script to recognize "--target=vxworks", and
	    generate load/install actions for VxWorks objects.
	+ move typedef for sigaction_t into SigAction.h to work around problem
	  generating lint library.
	+ modify fty_regex.c to reflect renaming of ifdef's for regular
	  expressions.
	+ simplify ifdef in lib_setup.c for TIOCGWINSZ since that symbol may
	  reside in <sys/ioctl.h>.
	+ merge testcurs.c with version from PDCurses 2.3, clarifying some of
	  the more obscure tests, which rely upon color.
	+ use macros getbegyx() and getmaxyx() in newdemo.c and testcurs.c
	+ modify ncurses.c to use getbegyx() and getmaxyx() macros to cover up
	  implementation difference wrt SVr4 curses, allow 's' test to work.
	+ add missing endwin() to testscanw.c program (reported by Fausto
	  Saporito <fausap@itb.it>).
	+ fixes/updates for Makefile.glibc and related files under sysdeps
	  (patch by H.J.Lu).
	> patches by Juergen Pfeifer:
	+ add checks for null pointers, especially WINDOW's throughout the
	  ncurses library.
	+ solve a problem with wrong calculation of panel overlapping (reported
	  by Ward Horner):
	  + make sure that a panel's window isn't a pad.
	  + do more error checking in module lib_touch.c
	+ missing files for Ada95 binding from the last patch
	+ synch. of generated html pages (RCS-Id's were wrong in html files)
	+ support for Key_Resize in Ada binding
	+ changed documentation style in ./c++/cursesm.h
	> patches by Alexander V. Lukyanov:
	+ undo attempt to do recursive inlining for PutChar(), noting that it
	  did not improve timing measurably, but inflated the size of
	  lib_doupdate.o

970913
	+ modify rain.c to use color.
	+ correct scroll_csr_backward() to match scroll_csr_forward().
	+ minor adjustment to llib-lncurses, to work with Solaris 2.5.1
	+ minor fixes to sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/configure to reflect renaming
	  of configure cache variables in 970906.
	+ correct logic involving changes to O_VISIBLE option in
	  Synchronize_Options function in frm_driver.c (Tony Hoffmann
	  <Tony.Hoffmann@hia.nrc.ca>)
	+ add $(HOSTCC) symbol to ncurses Makefile.in, to simplify setup for
	  cross compiling (suggested by Chris Johns).
	+ modify ifdef in lib_setup.c to only include <sys/ioctl.h> if we can
	  use it to support screen-size calculation (reported by Chris Johns).
	+ #undef unctrl to avoid symbol conflict in port to RTEMS (reported by
	  Chris Johns <cjohns@plessey.com.au>)
	> patches by Juergen Pfeifer:
	+ simplified, made minor corrections to Ada95 binding to form fieldtype.
	+ The C++ binding has been enhanced:
	  + Improve NCursesWindow class:  added additional methods to cover
	    more ncurses functionality.  Make refresh() and noutrefresh()
	    virtual members to allow different implementation in the
	    NCursesPanel class.
	  + CAUTION:  changed order of parameters in vline() and hline() of
	    NCursesWindow class.
	  + Make refresh() in NCursesPanel non-static, it is now a
	    reimplementation of refresh() in the base class.  Added
	    noutrefresh() to NCursesPanel.
	  + Added NCursesForm and related classes to support libform
	    functionality.
	  + Moved most of configuration related stuff from cursesw.h to etip.h
	  + Added NCursesApplication class to support easy configuration of
	    menu and forms related attributes as well as ripped of title lines
	    and Soft-Label-Keys for an application.
	  + Support of Auto-Cleanup for a menu's fieldlist.
	  + Change of return type for current_item() and operator[] for menus.
	  + Enhanced demo.
	+ Fixed a bug in form/fld_def.c:  take into account that copyarg and
	  freearg for a fieldtype may be NULL, makearg must not be NULL
	+ Fixed a bug in form/fld_type.c:  in set_fieldtype_arg() makearg must
	  not be NULL, copyarg and freearg may be NULL.
	+ Fixed a bug in form/frm_def.c:  Allow Disconnect_Fields() if it is
	  already disconnected.
	+ Enhance form/frm_driver.c:  Allow growth of dynamic fields also on
	  navigation requests.
	+ Fixed a bug in form/fty_enum.c:  wrong position of postincrement in
	  case-insensitiva comparision routine.
	+ Enhanced form/lib_adabind.c with function _nc_get_field() to get a
	  forms field by index.
	+ Enhanced menu/m_adabind.c with function _nc_get_item() to get a menus
	  item by index.
	+ Fixed in curses.h.in:  make chtype argument for pechochar() constant.
	  Mark wbkgdset() as implemented, remove wbkgdset macro, because it was
	  broken (didn't handle colors correctly).
	+ Enhanced lib_mouse.c: added _nc_has_mouse() function
	+ Added _nc_has_mouse() prototype to curses.priv.h
	+ Modified lib_bkgd.c:  hopefully correct implementation of wbkgdset();
	  streamlined implementation of wbkgd()
	+ Modified lib_mvwin.c:  Disable move of a pad.  Implement (costly)
	  move of subwindows.  Fixed update behaviour of movements of regular
	  windows.
	+ Fixed lib_pad.c:  make chtype argument of pechochar() const.
	+ Fixed lib_window.c:  dupwin() is not(!) in every bit a really clone
	  of the original.  Subwindows become regular windows by doing a
	  dupwin().
	+ Improved manpage form_fieldtype.3x
	> patches by Alexander V. Lukyanov:
	+ simplify the PutChar() handling of exit_am_mode, because we already
	  know that auto_right_margin is true.
	+ add a check in PutChar() for ability to insert to the case of
	  shifting character to LR corner.
	+ in terminal initialization by _nc_screen_resume(), make sure that
	  terminal right margin mode is known.
	+ move logic that invokes touchline(), or does the equivalent, into
	  _nc_scroll_window().
	+ modify scrolling logic use of insert/delete line capability, assuming
	  that they affect the screen contents only within the current
	  scrolling region.
	+ modify rain.c to demonstrate SIGWINCH handler.
	+ remove logic from getch() that would return an ERR if the application
	  called getch() when the cursor was at the lower-right corner of the
	  physical screen, and the terminal does not have insert-character
	  ability.
	+ change view.c so that it breaks out of getch() loop if a KEY_RESIZE
	  is read, and modify logic in getch() so this fix will yield the
	  desired behavior, i.e., the screen is repainted automatically when
	  the terminal window is resized.

970906
	+ add configure option --enable-sigwinch
	+ modify view.c to test KEY_RESIZE logic, with "-r" option.
	+ modify testcurs.c to eliminate misleading display wrt cursor type
	  by testing if the terminal supports cnorm, civis, cvvis.
	+ several fixes for m68k/NeXT 4.0, to bring cur_term, _nc_curr_line and
	  _nc_curr_col variables into linked programs:  move these variables,
	  making new modules lib_cur_term and trace_buf (reported by Francisco
	  Alberto Tomei Torres <fatomei@sandburg.unm.edu>).
	> patches by Alexander V. Lukyanov:
	+ add pseudo-functionkey KEY_RESIZE which is returned by getch() when
	  the SIGWINCH handler has been called since the last call to
	  doupdate().
	+ modify lib_twait.c to hide EINTR only if HIDE_EINTR is defined.
	+ add SIGWINCH handler to ncurses library which is used if there is no
	  application SIGWINCH handler in effect when the screen is
	  initialized.
	+ make linked list of all SCREEN structures.
	+ move curses.h include before definition of SCREEN to use types in
	  that structure.
	+ correction to ensure that wgetstr uses only a newline to force a
	  scroll (970831).

970831
	+ add experimental configure option --enable-safe-sprintf; the normal
	  mode now allocates a buffer as large as the screen for the
	  lib_printw.c functions.
	+ modify wgetch to refresh screen when reading ungetch'd characters,
	  since the application may require this - SVr4 does this.
	+ refine treatment of newline in wgetstr to echo only when this would
	  force the screen to scroll.

970830
	+ remove override in wgetstr() that forces keypad(), since SVr4 does
	  not do this.
	+ correct y-reference for erasure in wgetstr() when a wrap forces a
	  scroll.
	+ correct x-position in waddch() after a wrap forces a scroll.
	+ echo newline in wgetstr(), making testscanw.c scroll properly when
	  scanw is done.
	+ modify vwscanw() to avoid potential buffer overflow.
	+ rewrote lib_printw.c to eliminate fixed-buffer limits.
	> patches by Alexander V. Lukyanov:
	+ correct an error in handling cooked mode in wgetch(); processing
	  was in the wrong order.
	+ simplified logic in wgetch() that handles backspace, etc., by using
	  wechochar().
	+ correct wechochar() so that it interprets the output character as
	  in waddch().
	+ modify pechochar() to use prefresh() rather than doupdate(), since
	  the latter does not guarantee immediate refresh of the pad.
	+ modify pechochar() so that if called with a non-pad WINDOW, will
	  invoke wechochar() instead.
	+ modify fifo indices to allow fifo to be longer than 127 bytes.

970823
	+ add xterm-8bit to terminfo.src
	+ moved logic for SP->_fifohold inside check_pending() to make it
	  work properly when we add calls to that function.
	+ ensure that bool functions return only TRUE or FALSE, and TRUE/FALSE
	  are assigned to bool values (patch by H.J.Lu).
	> patches by Alexander V. Lukyanov:
	+ several fixes to getch:
	  1.  Separate cooked and raw keys in fifo
	  2.  Fix the case of ungetch'ed KEY_MOUSE
	  3.  wrap the code for hiding EINTR with ifdef HIDE_EINTR
	  4.  correctly handle input errors (i.e., EINTR) without loss of raw
	      keys
	  5.  recognize ESC KEY_LEFT and similar
	  6.  correctly handle the case of receiption of KEY_MOUSE from gpm
	+ correct off-by-one indexing error in _nc_mouse_parse(), that caused
	  single mouse events (press/release) to be ignored in favor of
	  composed events (click).  Improves on a fix from integrating gpm
	  support in 961229.
	+ add another call to check_pending, before scrolling, for
	  line-breakout optimization
	+ improve hashmap.c by
	  1.  fixed loop condition in grow_hunks()
	  2.  not marking lines with offset 0
	  3.  fixed condition of 'too far' criteria, thus one-line hunks are
	  ignored and two lines interchanged won't pass.
	+ rewrote/simplified _nc_scroll_optimize() by separating into two
	  passes, forward/backward, looking for chunks moving only in the given
	  direction.
	+ move logic that emits sgr0 when initializing the screen to
	  _nc_screen_init(), now invoked from newterm.
	+ move cursor-movement cleanup from endwin() into _nc_mvcur_wrap()
	  function and screen cleanup (i.e., color) into _nc_screen_wrap()
	  function.
	+ add new functions _nc_screen_init(), _nc_screen_resume() and
	  _nc_screen_wrap().
	+ rename _nc_mvcur_scrolln() to _nc_scrolln().
	+ add a copy of acs_map[] to the SCREEN structure, where it can be
	  stored/retrieved via set_term().
	+ move variables _nc_idcok, _nc_idlok, _nc_windows into the SCREEN
	  structure.

970816
	+ implement experimental _nc_perform_scroll().
	+ modify newterm (actually _nc_setupscreen()) to emit an sgr0 when
	  initializing the screen, as does SVr4 (reported by Alexander V.
	  Lukyanov).
	+ added test_progs rule to ncurses/Makefile.
	+ modify test/configure.in to check if initscr is already in $LIBS
	  before looking for (n)curses library.
	+ correct version-number in configure script for OSF1 shared-library
	  options (patch by Tim Mooney).
	+ add -DNDEBUG to CPPFLAGS for --enable-assertions (as Juergen
	  originally patched) since the c++ demo files do not necessarily
	  include ncurses_cfg.h
	+ supply default value for --enable-assertions option in configure
	  script (reported by Kriang Lerdsuwanakij <lerdsuwa@scf-fs.usc.edu>).
	> patches by Alexander V. Lukyanov:
	+ correct/simplify logic of werase(), wclrtoeol() and wclrbot().  See
	  example firstlast.c
	+ optimize waddch_literal() and waddch_nosync() by factoring out
	  common subexpressions.
	+ correct sense of NDEBUG ifdef for CHECK_POSITION macro.
	+ corrections to render_char(), to make handling of colored blanks
	  match SVr4 curses, as well as to correct a bug that xor'd space
	  against the background character.
	+ replaced hash function with a faster one (timed it)
	+ rewrote the hashmap algorithm to be one-pass, this avoids multiple
	  cost_effective() calls on the same lines.
	+ modified cost_effective() so it is now slightly more precise.
	> patches by H.J.Lu for glibc integration:
	+ add modules define_key, keyok, name_match, tries
	+ add makefile rules for some of the unit tests in ncurses (mvcur,
	  captoinfo, hardscroll, hashmap).
	+ update Linux configure-script for wide-character definitions.

970809
	+ modify _tracebits() to show the character size (e.g., CS8).
	+ modify tparm() to emit '\200' where the generated string would have a
	  null (reported by From:  Ian Dall <Ian.Dall@dsto.defence.gov.au> for
	  terminal type ncr7900).
	+ modify install process so that ldconfig is not invoked if the
	  package is built with an install-prefix.
	+ correct test program for chtype size (reported by Tim Mooney).
	+ add configure option --disable-scroll-hints, using this to ifdef the
	  logic that computes indices for _nc_scroll_optimize().
	+ add module ncurses/softscroll.c, to perform single-stage computation
	  of scroll indices used in _nc_scroll_optimize().  This is faster than
	  the existing scrolling algorithm, but tends to make too-small hunks.
	+ eliminate fixed buffer size in _nc_linedump().
	+ minor fixes to lib_doupdate.c to add tradeoff between clr_eol (el)
	  and clr_bol (el1), refine logic in ClrUpdate() and ClrBottom() (patch
	  by Alexander V. Lukyanov).
	+ add test/testaddch.c, from a pending patch by Alexander V. Lukyanov.
	+ correct processing of "configure --enable-assertions" option (patch
	  by Juergen Pfeifer).

970802
	+ add '-s' (single-step) option too test/hashtest.c, correct an error
	  in loop limit for '-f' (footer option), toggle scrollok() when
	  writing footer to avoid wrap at lower-right corner.
	+ correct behavior of clrtoeol() immediately after wrapping cursor,
	  which was not clearing the line at the cursor position (reported by
	  Liviu Daia <daia@stoilow.imar.ro>).
	+ corrected mapping for ACS_LANTERN, which was 'I' rather than 'i'
	  (reported by Klaus Weide <kweide@tezcat.com>).
	+ many corrections to make progs/capconvert work, as well as make it
	  reasonably portable and integrated with ncurses 4.1 (reported by Dave
	  Furstenau <df@ravine.binary.net>).

970726
	+ add flag SP->_fifohold, corresponding logic to modify the behavior of
	  the line breakout logic so that if the application does not read
	  input, refreshes will not be stopped, but only slowed.
	+ generate slk_attr_off(), slk_attr_on(), slk_attr_set(), vid_attr(),
	  ifdef'd for wide-character support, since ncurses' WA_xxx attribute
	  masks are identical with the A_xxx masks.
	+ modify MKlib_gen.sh to generate ifdef'd functions to support optional
	  configuration of wide-characters.
	+ modify tset to behave more like SVr4's tset, which does not modify
	  the settings of intr, quit or erase unless they are given as command
	  options (reported by Nelson H. F. Beebe <beebe@math.utah.edu>).
	+ modify tset to look in /etc/ttys or /etc/ttytype if the configuration
	  does not have getttynam().
	+ extend baudrate table in tset.c to match baudrate() function.
	+ add table entries for 230400 and 460800 bd to baudrate() function.
	+ improve breakout logic by allowing it before the first line updated,
	  which is what SVr4 curses does (patch by Alexander V. Lukyanov).
	+ correct initialization of vcost in relative_move(), for cursor-down
	  case (patch by Alexander V. Lukyanov).
	> nits gleaned from Debian distribution of 1.9.9g-3:
	+ install symbolic link for intotocap.
	+ reference libc directly when making shared libraries.
	+ correct renaming of curs_scr_dmp.3x in man_db.renames.
	+ guard tgetflag() and other termcap functions against null cur_term
	  pointer.

970719
	+ corrected initial state of software echo (error in 970405, reported
	  by Alexander V. Lukyanov).
	+ reviewed/added messages to configure script, so that all non-test
	  options should be accompanied by a message.
	+ add configure check for long filenames, using this to determine if
	  it is safe to allow long aliases for terminal descriptions as does
	  SVr4.
	+ add configure options for widec (wide character), hashmap (both
	  experimental).
	> patch by Alexander V. Lukyanov:
	+ hashmap.c - improved by heuristic, so that scroll test works much
	  better when csr is not available.
	+ hardscroll.c - patched so that it continues to scroll other chunks
	  after failure to scroll one.
	+ lib_doupdate.c - _nc_mvcur_scrolln extended to handle more cases; csr
	  is avoided as it is relative costly.  Fixed wrong coordinates in one
	  case and wrong string in TRACE.
	> patch by Juergen Pfeifer:
	+ modify C++ binding to compile on AIX 4.x with the IBM C-SET++
	  compiler.

970712
	+ remove alternate character set from kterm terminfo entry; it uses the
	  shift-out control for a purpose incompatible with curses, i.e., font
	  switching.
	+ disentangle 'xterm' terminfo entry from some derived entries that
	  should be based on xterm-r6 instead.
	+ add cbt to xterm-xf86-xv32 terminfo entry; I added the emulation for
	  XFree86 3.1.2F, but overlooked its use in terminfo then - T.Dickey.
	+ correct logic in lib_mvcur.c that uses back_tab.

970706
	+ correct change from 970628 to ClrUpdate() in lib_doupdate.c so that
	  contents of curscr are saved in newscr before clearing the screen.
	  This is needed to make repainting work with the present logic of
	  TransformLine().
	+ use napms() rather than sleep() in tset.c to avoid interrupting I/O.

970705
	+ add limit checks to _nc_read_file_entry() to guard against overflow
	  of buffer when reading incompatible terminfo format, e.g, from OSF/1.
	+ correct some loop-variable errors in xmc support in lib_doupdate.c
	+ modify ncurses 'b' test to add gaps, specified by user, to allow
	  investigation of interaction with xmc (magic cookie) code.
	+ correct typo in 970524 mods to xmas.c, had omitted empty parameter
	  list from has_colors(), which gcc ignores, but SVr4 does not
	  (reported by Larry Virden).
	+ correct rmso capability in wy50-mc description.
	+ add configure option "--enable-hard-tabs", renamed TABS_OK ifdef to
	  USE_HARD_TABS.
	> patch by Juergen Pfeifer:
	+ Add bindings for keyok() and define_key() to the Ada95 packages.
	+ Improve man pages menu_post.3x and menu_format.3x
	+ Fix the HTML pages in the Ada95/html directory to reflect the above
	  changes.

970628
	+ modify change from 970101 to ClrUpdate() in lib_doupdate.c so that
	  pending changes to both curscr and newscr are flushed properly.
	  This fixes a case where the first scrolling operation in nvi would
	  cause the screen to be cleared unnecessarily and repainted before
	  doing the indexing, i.e., by repeatedly pressing 'j' (reported by
	  Juergen Pfeifer).
	+ correct error in trans_string() which added embedded newlines in a
	  terminfo description to the stored strings.
	+ remove spurious newlines from sgr in wyse50 (and several other)
	  terminfo descriptions.
	+ add configure option for experimental xmc (magic cookie) code,
	  "--enable-xmc-glitch".  When disabled (the default), attributes that
	  would store a magic cookie are suppressed in vidputs().  The magic
	  cookie code is far from workable at this stage; the configuration
	  option is a stopgap.
	+ move _nc_initscr() from lib_initscr.c to lib_newterm.c
	+ correct path for invoking make_keys (a missing "./").

970621
	+ correct sign-extension problem with "infocmp -e", which corrupted
	  acsc values computed for linux fallback data.
	+ correct dependency on ncurses/names.c (a missing "./").
	+ modify configure script to use '&&' even for cd'ing to existing
	  directories to work around broken shell interpreters.
	+ correct a loop-limit in _nc_hash_map() (patch by Alexander V.
	  Lukyanov).

970615
	+ restore logic in _nc_scroll_optimize() which marks as touched the
	  lines in curscr that are shifted.
	+ add new utility 'make_keys' to compute keys.tries as a table rather
	  than a series of function calls.
	+ correct include-dependency for tic.h used by name_match
	+ removed buffer-allocation for name and description from m_item_new.c,
	  since this might result in incompatibilities with SVr4.  Also fixed
	  the corresponding Ada95 binding module (patch by Juergen Pfeifer,
	  from report by Avery Pennarun <apenwarr@foxnet.net>)
	+ removed the mechanism to timestamp the generated Ada95 sources.  This
	  resulted always in generating patches for the HTML doc, even when
	  nothing really changed (patch by Juergen Pfeifer).
	+ improve man page mitem_new.3x (patch by Juergen Pfeifer).

970614
	+ remove ech capability from rxvt description because it does not work.
	+ add missing case logic for infocmp -I option (reported by Lorenzo M.
	  Catucci <lorenzo@argon.roma2.infn.it>)
	+ correct old bug in pnoutrefresh() unmasked by fix in 970531; this
	  caused glitches in the ncurses 'p' test since the area outside the
	  pad was not compared when setting up indices for _nc_scroll_optimize.
	+ rewrote tracebits() to workaround misdefinition of TOSTOP on Ultrix
	  4.4, as well as to eliminate fixed-size buffer (reported by Chris
	  Tanner <tannerc@aecl.ca>)
	+ correct prototype for termattrs() as per XPG4 version 2.
	+ add placeholder prototypes for color_set(), erasewchar(),
	  term_attrs(), wcolor_set() as per XPG4 version 2.
	+ correct attribution for progs/progs.priv.h and lib_twait.c
	+ improve line-breakout logic by checking based on changed lines rather
	  than total lines (patch by Alexander V. Lukyanov).
	+ correct loop limits for table-lookup of enumerated value in form
	  (patch by Juergen Pfeifer).
	+ improve threshhold computation for determining when to call ClrToEOL
	  (patch by Alexander V. Lukyanov).

970531
	+ add configure option --disable-database to force the library to
	  use only the fallback data.
	+ add configure option --with-fallbacks, to specify list of fallback
	  terminal descriptions.
	+ add a symbolic link for ncurses.h during install; too many programs
	  still assume there's an ncurses.h
	+ add new terminfo.src entry for xterm-xf86-v33.
	+ restore terminfo.src entry for emu to using setf/setb, since it is
	  not, after all, generating ANSI sequences.  Corrected missing comma
	  that caused setf/setb entries to merge.
	+ modify mousemask() to use keyok() to enable/disable KEY_MOUSE, so
	  that applications can disable ncurses' mouse and supply their own
	  handler.
	+ add extensions keyok() and define_key().  These are designed to allow
	  the user's application better control over the use of function keys,
	  e.g., disabling the ncurses KEY_MOUSE.  (The define_key idea was from
	  a mailing-list thread started by kjahds@kjahds.com Nov'1995).
	+ restore original behavior in ncurses 'g' test, i.e., explicitly
	  set the keypad mode rather than use the default, since it confuses
	  people.
	+ rewrote the newdemo banner so it's readable (reported by Hugh Daniel).
	+ tidy up exit from hashtest (reported by Hugh Daniel).
	+ restore check for ^Q in ncurses 'g' test broken in 970510 (reported
	  by Hugh Daniel)
	+ correct tput program, checking return-value of setupterm (patch by
	  Florian La Roche).
	+ correct logic in pnoutrefresh() and pechochar() functions (reported
	  by Kriang Lerdsuwanakij <lerdsuwa@scf.usc.edu>).  The computation
	  of 'wide' date to eric's #283 (1.9.9), and the pechochar bug to the
	  original implementation (1.9.6).
	+ correct typo in vt102-w terminfo.src entry (patch by Robert Wuest
	  <rwuest@sire.vt.com>)
	+ move calls of _nc_background() out of various loops, as its return
	  value will be the same for the whole window being operated on (patch
	  by J.T.Conklin).
	+ add macros getcur[xy] getbeg[xy] getpar[xy], which are defined in
	  SVr4 headers (patch by J.T.Conklin <jtc@NetBSD.ORG>)
	+ modify glibc addon-configure scripts (patch by H.J.Lu).
	+ correct a bug in hashmap.c: the size used for clearing the hashmap
	  table was incorrect, causing stack corruption for large values of
	  LINES, e.g., >MAXLINES/2 (patch by Alexander V. Lukyanov).
	+ eric's terminfo 9.13.23 & 9.13.24 changes: replaced minitel-2 entry,
	  added MGR, ansi-nt (note: the changes described for 9.13.24 have not
	  been applied).
	> several changes by Juergen Pfeifer:
	+ correct a missing error-return in form_driver.c when wrapping of a
	  field is not possible.
	+ correct logic in form_driver.c for configurations that do not have
	  memccpy() (reported by Sidik Isani <isani@cfht.hawaii.edu>)
	+ change several c++ binding functions to inline.
	+ modify c++ menu binding to inherit from panels, for proper
	  initialization.
	+ correct freeing of menu items in c++ binding.
	+ modify c++ binding to reflect removal of const from user data pointer
	  in forms/menus libraries.

970524
	+ add description of xterm-16color.
	+ modify name of shared-library on *BSD to end with $(REL_VERSION)
	  rather than $(ABI_VERSION) to match actual convention on FreeBSD
	  (cf: 960713).
	+ add OpenBSD to shared-library case, same as NetBSD and FreeBSD
	  (reported by Hugh Daniel <hugh@rat.toad.com>).
	+ corrected include-dependency in menu/Makefile so that "make install"
	  works properly w/o first doing "make".
	+ add fallback definition for isascii, used in infocmp.
	+ modify xmas to use color, and to exit right away when a key is
	  pressed.
	+ modify gdc so that the scrolled digits function as described (there
	  was no time delay between the stages, and the digits overwrote the
	  bounding box without tidying up).
	+ modify lib_color.c to use setaf/setab only for the ANSI color codes
	  0 through 7.  Using 16 colors requires setf/setb.
	+ modify ncurses 'c' test to work with 16 colors, as well as the normal
	  8 colors.
	+ remove const qualifier from user data pointer in forms and menus
	  libraries (patch by Juergen Pfeifer).
	+ rewrote 'waddchnstr()' to avoid using the _nc_waddch_nosync()
	  function, thereby not interpreting tabs, etc., as per spec (patch by
	  Alexander V. Lukyanov).

970517
	+ suppress check for pre-existing ncurses header if the --prefix
	  option is specified.
	+ add configure options "--with-system-type" and "--with-system-release"
	  to assist in checking the generated makefiles.
	+ add configure option "--enable-rpath" to allow installers to specify
	  that programs linked against shared libraries will have their library
	  path embedded, allowing installs into nonstandard locations.
	+ add flags to OSF1 shared-library options to specify version and
	  symbol file (patch by Tim Mooney <mooney@dogbert.cc.ndsu.NoDak.edu>)
	+ add missing definition for ABI_VERSION to c++/Makefile.in (reported
	  by Satoshi Adachi <adachi@wisdom.aa.ap.titech.ac.jp>).
	+ modify link flags to accommodate HP-UX linker which embeds absolute
	  pathnames in executables linked against shared libraries (reported by
	  Jason Evans <jasone@mrc.uidaho.edu>, solved by Alan Shutko
	  <ats@hubert.wustl.edu>).
	+ drop unnecessary check for attribute-change in onscreen_mvcur() since
	  mvcur() is the only caller within the library, and that check in turn
	  is exercised only from lib_doupdate.c (patch by Alexander V.
	  Lukyanov).
	+ add 'blank' parameter to _nc_scroll_window() so _nc_mvcur_scrolln()
	  can use the background of stdscr as a parameter to that function
	  (patch by Alexander V. Lukyanov).
	+ moved _nc_mvcur_scrolln() from lib_mvcur.c to lib_doupdate.c, to use
	  the latter's internal functions, as well as to eliminate unnecessary
	  cursor save/restore operations (patch by Alexander V. Lukyanov).
	+ omit parameter of ClrUpdate(), since it is called only for newscr,
	  further optimized/reduced by using ClearScreen() and TransformLine()
	  to get rid of duplicate code (patch by Alexander V. Lukyanov).
	+ modify scrolling algorithm in _nc_scroll_optimize() to reject hunks
	  that are smaller than the distance to be moved (patch by Alexander V.
	  Lukyanov).
	+ correct a place where the panel library was not ifdef'd in ncurses.c
	  (Juergen Pfeifer)
	+ documentation fixes (Juergen Pfeifer)

970515	4.1 release for upload to prep.ai.mit.edu
	+ re-tag changes since 970505 as 4.1 release.

970510
	+ modify ncurses 'g' test to allow mouse input
	+ modify default xterm description to include mouse.
	+ modify configure script to add -Wwrite-strings if gcc warnings are
	  enabled while configuring --enable-const (and fixed related warnings).
	+ add toggle, status display for keypad mode to ncurses 'g' test to
	  verify that keypad and scrollok are not inherited from parent window
	  during a call to newwin.
	+ correction to MKexpanded.sh to make it work when configure --srcdir is
	  used (reported by H.J.Lu).
	+ revise test for bool-type, ensuring that it checks if builtin.h is
	  available before including it, adding test for sizeof(bool) equal
	  to sizeof(short), and warning user if the size cannot be determined
	  (reported by Alexander V. Lukyanov).
	+ add files to support configuration of ncurses as an add-on library
	  for GNU libc (patch by H.J.Lu <hjl@lucon.org>)

970506
	+ correct buffer overrun in lib_traceatr.c
	+ modify change to lib_vidattr.c to avoid redundant orig_pair.
	+ turn on 'echo()' in hanoi.c, since it is initially off.
	+ rename local 'errno' variable in etip.h to avoid conflict with global
	  (H.J.Lu).
	+ modify configure script to cache LD, AR, AR_OPTS (patch by H.J.Lu
	  <hjl@lucon.org>)

970505	4.1 pre-release
	+ regenerate the misc directory html dumps without the link list, which
	  is not useful.
	+ correct dependency in form directory makefile which caused unnecessary
	  recompiles.
	+ correct substitution for ABI_VERSION in test-makefile
	+ modify install rules for shared-library targets to remove the target
	  before installing, since some install programs do not properly handle
	  overwrite of symbolic links.
	+ change order of top-level targets so that 'include' immediate
	  precedes the 'ncurses' directory, reducing the time between new
	  headers and new libraries (requested by Larry Virden).
	+ modify lib_vidattr.c so that colors are turned off only before
	  modifying other attributes, turned on after others.  This makes the
	  hanoi.c program display correctly on FreeBSD console.
	+ modify debug code in panel library to print user-data addresses
	  rather than the strings which they (may) point to.
	+ add check to ensure that C++ binding and demo are not built with g++
	  versions below 2.7, since the binding uses templates.
	+ modify c++ binding and demo to build and run with SGI's c++ compiler.
	  (It also compiles with the Sun SparcWorks compiler, but the demo does
	  not link, due to a vtbl problem).
	+ corrections to demo.cc, to fix out-of-scope variables (Juergen
	  Pfeifer).

970503
	+ correct memory leak in _nc_trace_buf().
	+ add configure test for regexpr.h, for Unixware 1.x.
	+ correct missing "./" prefixing names of generated files in ncurses
	  directory.
	+ use single-quotes in configure scripts assignments for MK_SHARED_LIB
	  to workaround shell bug on FreeBSD 2.1.5
	+ remove tabs from intermediate #define's for GCC_PRINTF, GCC_SCANF
	  that caused incorrect result in ncurses_cfg.h
	+ correct initialization in lib_trace.c, which omitted version info.
	+ remove ech, el1 attributes from cons25w description; they appear to
	  malfunction in FreeBSD 2.1.5
	+ correct color attributes in terminfo.src and lib_color.c to match
	  SVr4 behavior by interchanging codes 1,4, 3,6 in the setf/setb
	  capabilities.
	+ use curs_set() rather than checks via tigetstr() for test programs
	  that hide the cursor: firework, rain, worm.
	+ ensure that if the terminal lacks change_scroll_region, parm_index
	  and parm_rindex are used only to scroll the whole screen (patch by
	  Peter Wemm).
	+ correct curs_set() logic, which did not return ERR if the requested
	  attributes did not exist, nor did it assume an unknown initial state
	  for the cursor (patch by Alexander V. Lukyanov).
	+ combine IDcTransformLine and NoIDcTransformLine to new TransformLine
	  function in lib_doupdate.c (patch by Alexander V. Lukyanov).
	+ correct hashmap.c, which did not update index information (patch by
	  Alexander V. Lukyanov).
	+ patch by Juergen Pfeifer for C++ binding and demo (see c++/NEWS)
	+ correct index in lib_instr.c (Juergen Pfeifer).
	+ correct typo in 970426 patch from Tom's cleanup of lib_overlay.c
	  (Juergen Pfeifer).

970426
	+ corrected cost computation in PutRange(), which was using
	  milliseconds compared to characters by adding two new members to the
	  SCREEN struct, _hpa_ch_cost and _cup_ch_cost.
	+ drop ncurses/lib_unctrl.c, add ncurses/MKunctrl.awk to generate a
	  const array of strings (suggested by Alexander V. Lukyanov, though
	  with a perl script 970118).
	+ rewrote ncurses 'b' test to better exercise magic-cookie (xmc), as
	  well as noting the attributes that are not supported by a terminal.
	+ trace the computation of cost values in lib_mvcur.c
	+ modify _nc_visbuf() to use octal rather than hex, corrected sign
	  extension bug in that function that caused buffer overflow.
	+ modify trace in lib_acs.c to use _nc_visbuf().
	+ suppress trace within _traceattr2().
	+ correct logic of _tracechtype2(), which did not account for repeats
	  or redefinition within an acsc string.
	+ modify debug-library version baudrate() to use environment variable
	  $BAUDRATE to override speed computation.  This is needed for
	  regression testing.
	+ correct problems shown by "weblint -pedantic".
	+ update mailing-list information (now ncurses@bsdi.com).

970419
	+ Improve form_field_validation.3x manpage to better describe the
	  precision parameter for TYPE_NUMERIC and TYPE_INTEGER.  Provide more
	  precise information how the range checking can be avoided.  (patch by
	  Juergen Pfeifer, reported by Bryan Henderson)
	+ change type of min/max value of form types TYPE_INTEGER to long to
	  match SVr4 documentation.
	+ set the form window to stdscr in set_form_win() so that form_win()
	  won't return null (patch by Juergen Pfeifer, reported by Bryan
	  Henderson <bryanh@giraffe.netgate.net>).

970412
	+ corrected ifdef'ing of inline (from 970321) for TRACE vs C++.
	+ corrected toggle_attr_off() macro (patch by Andries.Brouwer).
	+ modify treatment of empty token in $MANPATH to /usr/man (reported by
	  <Andries.Brouwer@cwi.nl>)
	+ modify traces that record functions-called so that chtype and attr_t
	  values are expressed symbolically, to simplify reuse of generated
	  test-scripts on SVr4 regression testing.
	+ add new trace functions _traceattr2() and _tracechtype2()

970405
	+ add configure option --enable-const, to support the use of 'const'
	  where XSI should have, but did not, specify.  This defines
	  NCURSES_CONST, which is an empty token otherwise, for strict
	  compatibility.
	+ make processing of configure options more verbose by echoing the
	  --enable/--with values.
	+ add configure option --enable-big-core
	+ set initial state of software echo off as per XSI.
	+ check for C++ builtin.h header
	+ correct computation of absolute-path for $INSTALL that dropped "-c"
	  parameter from the expression.
	+ rename config.h to ncurses_cfg.h to avoid naming-conflict when ncurses
	  is integrated into larger systems (from diffs by H.J.Lu for libc).
	+ correct inequality in lib_doupdate.c that caused a single-char to not
	  be updated when the char on the right-margin was not blank, idcok()
	  was true (patch by Alexander V.  Lukyanov 970124, also reported by
	  Kriang Lerdsuwanakij <lerdsuwa@scf-fs.usc.edu> 970329).
	+ modify 'clean' rule in include/Makefile so that files created by
	  configure script are removed in 'distclean' rule instead.

970328
	+ correct array limit in tparam_internal(), add case to interpret "%x"
	  (patch by Andreas Schwab)
	+ rewrote number-parsing in ncurses.c 'd' test; it did not reset the
	  value properly when non-numeric characters were given (reported by
	  Andreas Schwab <schwab@issan.informatik.uni-dortmund.de>)

970321
	+ move definition of __INTERNAL_CAPS_VISIBLE before include for
	  progs.priv.h (patch by David MacKenzie).
	+ add configuration summary, reordered check for default include
	  directory to better accommodate a case where installer is configuring
	  a second copy of ncurses (reported by Klaus Weide
	  <kweide@tezcat.com>)
	+ moved the #define for 'inline' as an empty token from the
	  $(CFLAGS_DEBUG) symbol into config.h, to avoid redefinition warning
	  (reported by Ward Horner).
	+ modify test for bool builtin type to use 'unsigned' rather than
	  'unknown' when cross-compiling (reported by Ward Horner).

970315
	+ add header dependencies so that "make install.libs" will succeed
	  even if "make all" is not done first.
	+ moved some macros from lib_doupdate.c to curses.priv.h to use in
	  expanded functions with ATAC.
	+ correct implementation of lib_instr.c; both XSI and SVr4 agree that
	  the winnstr functions can return more characters than will fit on one
	  line.

970308
	+ modify script that generates lib_gen.c to support traces of called &
	  return.
	+ add new configure option "--disable-macros", for testing calls within
	  lib_gen.c
	+ corrected logic that screens level-checking of called/return traces.

970301
	+ use new configure macro NC_SUBST to replace AC_PATH_PROG, better
	  addressing request by Ward Horner.
	+ check for cross-compiling before trying to invoke the autoconf
	  AC_FUNC_SETVBUF_REVERSED macro (reported by Ward Horner)
	+ correct/simplify loop in _nc_visbuf(), 970201 changes omitted
	  a pointer-increment.
	+ eliminate obsolete symbol SHARED_ABI from dist.mk (noted by
	  Florian La Roche).

970215
	+ add configure option --enable-expanded, together with code that
	  implements an expanded form of certain complex macros, for testing
	  with ATAC.
	+ disable CHECK_POSITION unless --with-assertions is configured
	  (Alexander Lukyanov pointed out that this is redundant).
	+ use keyname() to show traced chtype values where applicable rather
	  than _tracechar(), which truncates the value to 8-bits.
	+ minor fixes to TRACE_ICALLS, added T_CREATE, TRACE_CCALLS macros.
	+ modify makefiles in progs and test directories to avoid using C
	  preprocessor options on link commands (reported by Ward Horner)
	+ correct ifdef/include-order for nc_alloc.h vs lib_freeall.c (reported
	  by Ward Horner)
	+ modify ifdef's to use configure-defined symbols consistently
	  (reported by Ward Horner)
	+ add/use new makefile symbols AR, AR_OPTS and LD to assist in non-UNIX
	  ports (reported by Ward Horner <whorner@tsi-telsys.com>)
	+ rename struct try to struct tries, to avoid name conflict with C++
	  (reported by Gary Johnson).
	+ modify worm.c to hide cursor while running.
	+ add -Wcast-qual to gcc warnings, fix accordingly.
	+ use PutChar rather than PutAttrChar in ClrToEOL to properly handle
	  wrapping (Alexander Lukyanov).
	+ correct spurious echoing of input in hanoi.c from eric's #291 & #292
	  patches (reported by Vernon C. Hoxie <vern@zebra.alphacdc.com>).
	+ extend IRIX configuration to IRIX64
	+ supply missing install.libs rule needed after restructuring
	  test/Makefile.in

970208
	+ modify "make mostlyclean" to leave automatically-generated source
	  in the ncurses directory, for use in cross-compiles.
	+ autogenerated object-dependencies for test directory
	+ add configure option --with-rcs-ids
	+ modify configuration scripts to generate major/minor/patch versions
	  (suggested by Alexander Lukyanov).
	+ supply missing va_end's in lib_scanw.c
	+ use stream I/O for trace-output, to eliminate fixed-size buffer
	+ add TRACE_ICALLS definition/support to lib_trace.c
	+ modify Ada95 binding to work with GNAT 3.09 (Juergen Pfeifer).

970201
	+ add/modify traces for called/return values to simplify extraction
	  for test scripts.
	+ changed _nc_visbuf to quote its result, and to dynamically allocate
	  the returned buffer.
	+ invoke ldconfig after installing shared library
	+ modify install so that overwrite applies to shared library -lcurses
	  in preference to static library (reported by Zeyd 960928).
	+ correct missing ';' in 961221 mod to overwrite option use of $(LN_S).
	+ fixes to allow "make install" to work without first doing a "make
	  all" (suggested by Larry Virden).

970125
	+ correct order of #ifdef for TABS_OK.
	+ instrumented toe.c to test memory-leaks.
	+ correct memory-deallocation in toe.c (patch by Jesse Thilo).
	+ include <sys/types.h> in configuration test for regex.h (patch by
	  Andreas Schwab)
	+ make infocmp recognize -I option, for SVr4 compatibility (reported by
	  Andreas Schwab <schwab@issan.informatik.uni-dortmund.de>)

970118
	+ add extension 'use_default_colors()', modified test applications that
	  use default background (firework, gdc, hanoi, knight, worm) to
	  demonstrate.
	+ correct some limit checks in lib_doupdate.c exposed while running
	  worm.
	+ use typeCalloc macro for readability.
	+ add/use definition for CONST to accommodate testing with Solaris
	  (SVr4) curses, which doesn't use 'const' in its prototypes.
	+ modify ifdef's in test/hashtest.c and test/view.c to compile with
	  Solaris curses.
	+ modify _tracedump() to pad pad colors & attrs lines to match change
	  in 970101 showing first/last changes.
	+ corrected location of terminating null on dynamically allocated forms
	  fields (patch by Per Foreby).

970111
	+ added headers to make view.c compile on SCO with the resizeterm()
	  code (i.e., struct winsize) - though this compiles, I don't have a
	  suitable test configuration since SIGWINCH doesn't pass my network to
	  that machine - T.Dickey.
	+ update test/configure.in to supply some default substitutions.
	+ modify configure script to add -lncurses after -lgpm to fix problem
	  linking against static libraries.
	+ add a missing noraw() to test/ncurses.c (places noted by Jeremy
	  Buhler)
	+ add a missing wclear() to test/testcurs.c (patch by Jeremy Buhler
	  <jbuhler@cs.washington.edu>)
	+ modify headers to accommodate compilers that don't allow duplicate
	  "#define" lines for NCURSES_VERSION (reported by Larry W. Virden
	  <lvirden@cas.org>)
	+ fix formatting glitch in curs_getch.3x (patch by Jesse Thilo).
	+ modify lib_doupdate to make el, el1 and ed optimization use the
	  can_clear_with macro, and change EmitRange to allow leaving cursor at
	  the middle of interval, rather than always at the end (patch by
	  Alexander Lukyanov originally 960929, resync 970106).

970104
	+ workaround defect in autoconf 2.12 (which terminates configuration
	  if no C++ compiler is found) by adding an option --without-cxx.
	+ modify several man-pages to use tbl, where .nf/.fi was used (reported
	  by Jesse Thilo).
	+ correct font-codes in some man-pages (patch by Jesse Thilo
	  <Jesse.Thilo@pobox.com>)
	+ use configure script's knowledge of existence of g++ library for the
	  c++ Makefile (reported by Paul Jackson).
	+ correct misleading description of --datadir configuration option
	  (reported by Paul Jackson <pj@sam.engr.sgi.com>)

970101
	+ several corrections to _nc_mvcur_scrolln(), prompted by a bug report
	  from Peter Wemm:
	> the logic for non_dest_scroll_region was interchanged between the
	  forward & reverse scrolling cases.
	> multiple returns from the function allowed certain conditions to do
	  part of an operation before discovering that it couldn't be
	  completed, returning an error without restoring the cursor.
	> some returns were ERR, where the function had completed the
	  operation, because the insert/delete line logic was improperly
	  tested (this was probably the case Peter saw).
	> contrary to comments, some scrolling cases were tested after the
	  insert/delete line method.
	+ modify _tracedump() to show first/last changes.
	+ modify param of ClrUpdate() in lib_doupdate.c to 'newscr', fixes
	  refresh problem (reported by Peter Wemm) that caused nvi to not show
	  result of ":r !ls" until a ^L was typed.

961229	(internal alpha)
	+ correct some of the writable-strings warnings (reported by Gary
	  Johnson <gjohnson@season.com>).  Note that most of the remaining ones
	  are part of the XSI specification, and can't be "fixed".
	+ improve include-dependencies in form, menu, panel directories.
	+ correct logic of delay_output(), which would return early if
	  there is data on stdin.
	+ modify interface & logic of _nc_timed_wait() to support 2 file
	  descriptors, needed for GPM.
	+ integrate patch by Andrew Kuchling <amk@magnet.com> for GPM (mouse)
	  support, correcting logic in wgetch() and _nc_mouse_parse() which
	  prevented patch from working properly.
	+ improve performance of panel algorithm (Juergen Pfeifer 961203).
	+ strip RCS id's from generated .html files in Ada95 subtree.
	+ resync with generated .html files (Juergen Pfeifer 961223).
	+ terminfo.src 10.1.0 from Eric.

961224	4.0 release
	+ release as 4.0 to accommodate Linux ld.so.1.8.5
	+ correct syntax/spelling, regenerated .doc files from .html using
	  lynx 2.5
	+ refined forms/menus makefiles (Juergen Pfeifer 961223).

961221	- snapshot
	+ remove logic in read_entry.c that attempts to refine errno by using
	  'access()' for the directory (from patch by Florian La Roche).
	+ correct configure test/substitution that inhibits generating
	  include-path to /usr/include if gcc is used (reported by Florian La
	  Roche).
	+ modify setupterm() to allocate new TERMINAL for each call, just as
	  solaris' curses does (Alexander Lukyanov 960829).
	+ corrected memory leaks in read_entry.c
	+ add configure options --with-dbmalloc, --with-dmalloc, and
	  --disable-leaks, tested by instrumenting infocmp, ncurses programs.
	+ move #include's for stdlib.h and string.h to *.priv.h to accommodate
	  use of dbmalloc.
	+ modify use of $(LN_S) to follow recommendation in autoconf 2.12,
	  i.e., set current directory before linking.
	+ split-out panel.priv.h, improve dependencies for forms, menus
	  (Juergen Pfeifer 961204).
	+ modify _nc_freewin() to reset globals curscr/newscr/stdscr when
	  freeing the corresponding WINDOW (Purify).
	+ modify delwin() to return ERR if the window to be deleted has
	  subwindows, needed as a side-effect of resizeterm() (Purify).  Tested
	  and found that SVr4 curses behaves this way.
	+ implement logic for _nc_freeall(), bringing stub up to date.

961215
	+ modify wbkgd() so that it doesn't set nulls in the rendered text,
	  even if its argument doesn't specify a character (fixes test case by
	  Juergen Pfeifer for bug-report).
	+ set window-attributes in wbkgd(), to simplify comparison against
	  Solaris curses, which does this.

961214	- snapshot
	+ replace most constants in ncurses 'o' test by expressions, making it
	  work with wider range of screen sizes.
	+ add options to ncurses.c to specify 'e' test softkey format, and the
	  number of header/footer lines to rip-off.
	+ add ^R (repaint after resize), ^L (refresh) commands to ncurses 'p'
	  test.
	+ add shell-out (!) command to ncurses 'p' test to allow test of
	  resize between endwin/refresh.
	+ correct line-wrap case in mvcur() by emitting carriage return,
	  overlooked in 960928, but needed due to SVr4 compatibility changes to
	  terminal modes in 960907.
	+ correct logic in wresize that causes new lines to be allocated,
	  broken for the special case of increasing rows only in 960907's fix
	  for subwindows.
	+ modify configure script to generate $(LDFLAGS) with -L and -l options
	  in preference to explicit library filenames.  (NOTE: this may
	  require further amending, since I vaguely recall a dynamic loader
	  that did not work properly without the full names, but it should be
	  handled as an exception to the rule, since some linkers do bulk
	  inclusion of libraries when given the full name - T.Dickey).
	+ modify configure script to allow user-supplied $CFLAGS to set the
	  debug-option in all libraries (requested by lots of people).
	+ use return consistently from main(), rather than exit (reported by
	  Florian La Roche).
	+ add --enable-getcap-cache option to configure, normally disabled
	  (requested by Florian La Roche).
	+ make configure test for gettimeofday() and possibly -lbsd more
	  efficient (requested by Florian La Roche florian@knorke.saar.de)
	+ minor adjustments to Ada95 binding (patches by Juergen Pfeifer)
	+ correct attributes after emitting orig_pair in lib_vidattr.c (patch
	  by lav@yars.free.net).

961208
	+ corrected README wrt Ada95 (Juergen Pfeifer)

961207	- snapshot
	+ integrate resizeterm() into doupdate(), so that if screen size
	  changes between endwin/refresh, ncurses will resize windows to fit
	  (this needs additional testing with pads and softkeys).
	+ add, for memory-leak testing, _nc_freeall() entrypoint to free all
	  data used in ncurses library.
	+ initialize _nc_idcok, _nc_idlok statically to resolve discrepancy
	  between initscr() and newwin() initialization (reported by
	  lav@yars.free.net).
	+ test built VERSION=4.0, SHARED_ABI=4 with Linux ld.so.1.8.5
	  (set beta versions to those values -- NOTE that subsequent pre-4.0
	  beta may not be interchangeable).
	+ modify configure script to work with autoconf 2.12

961130	1.9.9g release
	+ add copyright notices to configuration scripts (written by Thomas
	  Dickey).

961127
	> patch by Juergen Pfeifer (mostly for panel):
	+ cosmetic improvement for a few routines in the ncurses core library
	  to avoid warning messages.
	+ the panel overlap detection was broken
	+ the panel_window() function was not fool-proof.
	+ Some inlining...
	+ Cosmetic changes (also to avoid warning messages when compiling with
	  -DTRACE).

	> patch by Juergen Pfeifer:
	+ eliminates warning messages for the compile of libform.
	+ inserts Per Foreby's new field type TYPE_IPV4 into libform.
	+ Updates man page and the Ada95 binding to reflect this.
	+ Improves inlining in libmenu and libform.

961120
	+ improve the use of the "const" qualifier in the
	  panel library (Juergen Pfeifer)
	+ change set_panel_userptr() and panel_userptr() to use void*
	  (Juergen Pfeifer)

961119
	+ change ABI to 3.4
	+ package with 961119 version of Ada95 binding (fixes for gnat-3.07).
	  (Juergen Pfeifer)
	+ correct initialization of the stdscr pseudo panel in panel library
	  (Juergen Pfeifer)
	+ use MODULE_ID (rcs keywords) in forms and menus libraries (Juergen
	  Pfeifer).
	> patch #324 by Eric.
	+ typo in curs_termcap man page (reported by Hendrik Reichel
	  <106065.2344@compuserve.com>)
	+ change default xterm entry to xterm-r6.
	+ add entry for color_xterm

961116	- snapshot
	+ lint found several functions that had only #define implementations
	  (e.g., attr_off), modified curses.h.in to generate them as per XSI
	  Curses requirement that every macro be available as a function.
	+ add check in infocmp.c to guard against string compare of
	  CANCELLED_STRING values.
	+ modify firework.c, rain.c to hide cursor while running.
	+ correct missing va_end in lib_tparm.c
	+ modify hanoi.c to work on non-color terminals, and to use timing
	  delays when in autoplay mode.
	+ correct 'echochar()' to refresh immediately (reported by Adrian
	  Garside 94ajg2@eng.cam.ac.uk)
	> patch #322 by eric:
	+ reorganize terminfo.src entries for xterm.

961109	- snapshot
	+ corrected error in line-breakout logic (lib_doupdate.c)
	+ modified newdemo to use wgetch(win) rather than getch() to eliminate
	  a spurious clear-screen.
	+ corrected ifdef's for 'poll()' configuration.
	+ added modules to ncurses, form, menu for Ada95 binding (Juergen
	  Pfeifer).
	+ modify set_field_buffer() to allow assignment of string longer than
	  the initial buffer length, and to return the complete string rather
	  than only the initial size (Juergen Pfeifer and Per Foreby
	  <perf@efd.lth.se>).

961102	- snapshot
	+ configure for 'poll()' in preference to 'select()', since older
	  systems are more likely to have a broken 'select()'.
	+ modified render_char() to avoid OR'ing colors.
	+ minor fixes to testcurs.c, newdemo.c test programs: ifdef'd out the
	  resize test, use wbkgd and corrected box() parameters.
	+ make flushinp() test work in ncurses.c by using napms() instead of
	  sleep().
	+ undo Eric's changes to xterm-x11r6 (it no longer matched the X11R6.1
	  distribution, as stated)
	+ terminfo 9.13.18 (resync by Eric)
	+ check for getenv("HOME") returning null (Eric).
	+ change buffer used to decode xterm-mouse commands to unsigned to
	  handle displays wider than 128 chars (Juergen Pfeifer).
	+ correct typo curs_outopts.3x (Juergen Pfeifer).
	+ correct limit-checking in wenclose() (Juergen Pfeifer).
	+ correction to Peter Wemm's newwin change (Thomas Fehr <fehr@suse.de>).
	+ corrections to logic that combines colors and attributes; they must
	  not be OR'd (Juergen Pfeifer, extending from report/patch by Rick
	  Marshall).

961026	- snapshot
	+ reset flags in 'getwin()' that might cause refresh to attempt to
	  manipulate the non-existent parent of a window that is read from a
	  file (lib_screen.c).
	+ restructure _nc_timed_wait() to log more information, and to try to
	  recover from badly-behaved 'select()' calls (still testing this).
	+ move define for GOOD_SELECT into configure script.
	+ corrected extra '\' character inserted before ',' in comp_scan.c
	+ corrected expansion of %-format characters in dump_entry.c; some were
	  rendered as octal constants.
	+ modify dump_entry.c to make terminfo output more readable and like
	  SVr4, by using "\s" for spaces (leading/trailing only), "\," for
	  comma, "\^" and "\:" as well.
	+ corrected some memory leaks in ncurses.c, and a minor logic error
	  in the top-level command-parser.
	+ correction for label format 4 (PC style with info line), a
	  slk_clear(), slk_restore() sequence didn't redraw the info line
	  (Juergen Pfeifer).
	+ modified the slk window (if simulated) to inherit the background and
	  default character attributes from stdscr (Juergen Pfeifer).
	+ corrected limit-check in set_top_row (Juergen Pfeifer).

961019	- snapshot
	+ correct loop-limit in wnoutrefresh(), bug exposed during pipe-testing
	  had '.lastchar' entry one beyond '._maxx'.
	+ modify ncurses test-program to work with data piped to it.
	+ corrected pathname computation in run_tic.sh, removing extra "../"
	  (reported by Tim Mooney).
	+ modified configure script to use previous install's location for
	  curses.h
	+ added NetBSD and FreeBSD to platforms that use --prefix=/usr as
	  a default.

961013
	+ revised xterm terminfo descriptions to reflect the several versions
	  that are available.
	+ corrected a pointer reference in dump_entry.c that didn't test if
	  the pointer was -1.

961005	- snapshot
	+ correct _nc_mvcur_scrolln for terminals w/o scrolling region.
	+ add -x option to hashtest to control whether it allows writes to the
	  lower-right corner.
	+ ifdef'd (NCURSES_TEST) the logic for _nc_optimize_enable to make it
	  simpler to construct tests (for double-check of _nc_hash_map tests).
	+ correct ifdef's for c++ in curses.h
	+ change default xterm type to xterm-x11r6.
	+ correct quoting in configure that made man-pages installed with
	  $datadir instead of actual terminfo path.
	+ correct whitespace in include/Caps, which caused kf11, clr_eol and
	  clr_end to be omitted from terminfo.5
	+ fix memory leaks in delscreen() (adapted from Alexander Lukyanov).
	+ improve appearance of marker in multi-selection menu (Juergen
	  Pfeifer)
	+ fix behaviour for forms with all fields inactive (Juergen
	  Pfeifer)
	+ document 'field_index()' (Juergen Pfeifer)
	> patch #321 by eric:
	+ add some more XENIX keycap translations to include/Caps.
	+ modify newwin to set initial state of each line to 'touched'
	  (from patch by Peter Wemm <peter@spinner.dialix.com>)
	+ in SET_TTY, replace TCSANOW with TCSADRAIN (Alexander Lukyanov).

960928	- snapshot
	+ ifdef'd out _nc_hash_map (still slower)
	+ add graphic characters to vt52 description.
	+ use PutAttrChar in ClrToEOL to ensure proper background, position.
	+ simplify/correct logic in 'mvcur()' that does wrapping; it was
	  updating the position w/o actually moving the cursor, which broke
	  relative moves.
	+ ensure that 'doupdate()' sets the .oldindex values back to a sane
	  state; this was causing a spurious refresh in ncurses 'r'.
	+ add logic to configure (from vile) to guard against builders who
	  don't remove config.cache & config.status when doing new builds.
	+ corrected logic for 'repeat_char' in EmitRange (from #317), which
	  did not follow the 2-parameter scheme specified in XSI.
	+ corrected logic of wrefresh, wnoutrefresh broken in #319, making
	  clearok work properly (from report by Michael Elkins).
	+ corrected problem with endwin introduced by #314 (removing the
	  scrolling-region reset) that broke ncurses.c tests.
	+ corrected order of args in AC_CHECK_LIB (from report by Ami Fischman
	  <fischman@math.ucla.edu>).
	+ corrected formatting of terminfo.5 tables (Juergen Ehling)
	> patch 320 by eric:
	+ change ABI to 3.3
	+ emit a carriage-return in 'endwin()' to workaround a kernel bug in
	  BSDI.  (requested by Mike Karels <karels@redrock.bsdi.com>)
	+ reverse the default o configure --enable-termcap (consensus).
	> patch 319 by eric:
	+ modified logic for clearok and related functions (from report by
	  Michael Elkins) - untested
	> patch 318 by eric:
	+ correction to #317.
	> patch 317 by eric:
	+ re-add _nc_hash_map
	+ modify EmitRange to maintain position as per original design.
	+ add hashtest.c, program to time the hashmap optimization.
	> patch 316 by eric:
	+ add logic to deal with magic-cookie (how was this tested?)
	  (lib_doupdate.c).
	+ add ncurses.c driver for magic-cookie, some fixes to ncurses.c
	> patch 315 by eric:
	+ merged A. Lukyanov's patch to use ech and rep - untested

	  Ehling <eh@eclipse.aball.de>).
	+ update xterm-color to reflect XFree86 3.1.3G release.
	+ correct broken dtterm description from #314 patch (e.g., spurious
	  newline.  The 'pairs' change might work, but no one's tested it
	  either ;-)
	+ clarify the documentation for the builtin form fieldtypes (Juergen
	  Pfeifer)
	> patch 314 by eric:
	+ Enhancement suggested by A. Lukyanov -- reset scroll region on
	  startup rather than at wrapup time.
	+ Fix suggested by A. Lukyanov, make storage of palette tables
	  and their size counts per-screen for multi-terminal applications.
	+ Improved error reporting for infotocap translation errors.
	+ Update terminfo.src to 9.13.14.

960907	- snapshot
	+ rewrote wgetstr to make it erase control chars and also fix bogus use
	  of _nc_outstr which caused the display to not wrap properly (display
	  problem reported by John M. Flinchbaugh <glynis@netrax.net>)
	+ modify ncurses 'f' test to accommodate terminal responses to C1 codes
	  (and split up this screen to accommodate non-ANSI terminals).
	+ test enter_insert_mode and exit_insert_mode in has_ic().
	+ removed bogus logic in mvcur that assumes nl/nonl set output modes
	  (XSI says they are input modes; SVr4 implements this).
	+ added macros SET_TTY, GET_TTY to term.h
	+ correct getstr() logic that altered terminal modes w/o restoring.
	+ disable ICRNL, etc., during initialization to match SVr4, removing
	  the corresponding logic from raw, cbreak, etc.
	+ disable ONLCR during initialization, to match SVr4 (this is needed
	  for cursor optimization when the cursor-down is a newline).
	+ replaced Eric's imitation of wresize with my original (his didn't
	  work).

960831	- snapshot
	+ memory leaks (Alexander V. Lukyanov).
	+ modified pnoutrefresh() to be more tolerant of too-large screen
	  size (reported by Michael Elkins).
	+ correct handling of terminfo files with no strings (Philippe De
	  Muyter)
	+ correct "tic -s" to take into account -I, -C options.
	+ modify ncurses 'f' test to not print codes 80 through 9F, since they
	  are considered control codes by ANSI terminals.

960824	- snapshot
	+ correct speed variable-type in 'tgetent()' (reported by Peter Wemm)
	+ make "--enable-getcap" configuration-option work (reported by
	  Peter Wemm <peter@spinner.DIALix.COM>)

960820
	+ correct err in 960817 that changed return-value of tigetflag()

	+ correct interaction between O_BLANK and NEW_LINE request in form
	  library (Juergen Pfeifer)

	  (reported by William P Setzer)
	+ add fallback def for GCC_NORETURN, GCC_UNUSED for termcap users
	  (reported by Tim Mooney).
	> patch 310 by eric:
	+ documentation and prototyping errors for has_color, immedok and idcok
	  (reported by William P Setzer <wsetzer@pams.ncsu.edu>)
	+ updated qnx terminfo entry (by Michael Hunter)

960730
	+ eliminate quoted includes in ncurses subdirectory, ensure config.h
	  is included first.
	+ newterm initializes terminal settings the same as initscr (reported
	  by Tim Mooney).

960727	- snapshot
	+ call cbreak() in initscr(), as per XSI & SVr4.
	+ turn off hardware echo in initscr() as per XSI & SVr4
	> patch 309 by eric:
	+ terminfo changes (9.3.10), from BRL
	+ add more checks to terminfo parser.
	+ add more symbols to infocmp.

	  Ju"rgen Fluk <louis@dachau.marco.de>)
	+ corrected calls on _nc_render so that background character is set
	  as per XSI.
	+ corrected wbkgdset macro (XSI allows background character to be null),
	  and tests that use it.
	+ more corrections to terminfo (xterm & rxvt)
	+ undid change to mcprint prototype (cannot use size_t in curses.h
	  because not all systems declare it in the headers that we can safely
	  include therein).
	+ move the ifdefs for errno into curses.priv.h
	> patch 308 by eric:
	+ terminfo changes (9.3.8)
	+ modified logic of error-reporting in terminfo parser

960713	- snapshot
	+ always check for <sys/bsdtypes.h> since ISC needs it to declare
	  fd_set (Juergen Pfeifer)
	+ install shared-libraries on NetBSD/FreeBSD with ABI-version (reported
	  by several people:  Juergen Pfeifer, Mike Long)
	+ add LOCAL_LDFLAGS2 symbol (Juergen Pfeifer)
	+ corrected prototype for delay_output() -- bump ABI to 3.2
	+ terminfo patches #306/307 from Eric.
	+ moved logic that filters out rmul and rmso from setupterm to newterm
	  where it is less likely to interfere with termcap applications.

960707
	+ rollback Eric's #305 change to terminfo.src (it breaks existing
	  applications, e.g., 'less 290').
	+ correct path of edit_man.sh, and fix typo that made all man-pages
	  preformatted.
	+ restore man/menu_requestname.3x omitted in Zeyd's resync (oops).
	+ auto-configure the GCC_PRINTFLIKE/GCC_SCANFLIKE macros (reported by
	  Philippe De Muyter).

960706	- snapshot
	+ make lib_vidattr.c more readable using macros.
	+ filter out rmul, rmso that conflict with sgr0 when reading terminal
	  descriptions.
	+ added sanity-checking of various paired string attributes (Eric).
	+ work around autoconf bug, force $INSTALL to absolute path.
	  (reported by Zeyd).
	+ modify man-page install for BSDI to install preformatted .0 files
	  (reported by David MacKenzie).
	+ add/use gcc __attribute__ for printf and scanf in curses.h
	+ added SGR attributes test-case to ncurses

	+ use getopt in ncurses program to process -s and -t options.
	+ make ncurses 'p' legend toggle with '?'
	+ disable scrollok during the ncurses 'p' test; if it is enabled the
	  stdscr will scroll when putting the box-corners in the lower-right
	  of the screen.

960629	- snapshot
	+ check return code of _nc_mvcur_scrolln() in _nc_scroll_optimize() for
	  terminals with no scrolling-support (reported by Nikolay Shadrin
	  <queen@qh.mirea.ac.ru>)
	+ added ^S scrollok-toggle to ncurses 'g' test.
	+ added ^T trace-toggle to ncurses tests.
	+ modified ncurses test program to use ^Q or ESC consistently for
	  terminating tests (rather than ^D), and to use control keys rather
	  than function keys in 'g' test.
	+ corrected misplaced wclrtoeol calls in addch to accommodate wrapping
	  (reported by Philippe De Muyter).
	+ modify lib_doupdate.c to use effective costs to tradeoff between
	  delete-character/insert-character vs normal updating (reported by
	  David MacKenzie).
	+ compute effective costs for screen update operations (e.g., clr_eos,
	  delete_character).
	+ corrected error in knight.c exposed by wrap fixes in 960622; the
	  msgwin needed scrollok set.
	+ corrected last change to IDcTransformLine logic to avoid conflict
	  between PutRange and InsStr
	+ modified run_tic.sh to not use /usr/tmp (reported by David MacKenzie),
	  and further revised it and aclocal.m4 to use $TMPDIR if set.
	+ corrected off-by-one in RoomFor call in read_entry.c

960622	- snapshot
	+ modified logic that wraps cursor in addch to follow the XSI spec,
	  (implemented in SVr4) which states that the cursor position is
	  updated when wrapping.  Renamed _NEED_WRAP to _WRAPPED to reflect the
	  actual semantics.
	+ added -s option to tic, to provide better diagnostics in run_tic.sh
	+ improved error-recovery for tabset install.
	+ change ABI to 3.1 (dropped tparam, corrected getbkgd(), added
	  _yoffset to WINDOW).
	+ modified initialization of SP->_ofp so that init_acs() is called with
	  the "right" file pointer (reported by Rick Marshall <rjm@nlc.net.au>
	+ documentation fixes (Juergen Pfeifer).

	  attributes).
	+ modified lib_doupdate.c to use lower-level SP's current_attr state
	  instead of curscr's state, since it is redundant.
	+ correction to IDcTransformLine logic which controls where InsStr is

### ncurses-1.9.8a -> 1.9.9e

* fixed broken wsyncup()/wysncdown(), as a result wnoutrefresh() now has
  copy-changed-lines behavior.
* added and documented wresize() function.
* more fixes to LOWER-RIGHT corner handling.
* changed the line-breakout optimization code to allow some lines to be
  emitted before the first check.
* added option for tic to use symbolic instead of hard links (for AFS)
* fix to restore auto-wrap mode.
* trace level can be controlled by environment variable.
* better handling of NULs in terminal descriptions.
* improved compatibility with observed SVR4 behavior.
* the refresh behavior of over-lapping windows is now more efficient and
  behaves like SVR4.
* use autoconf 2.7, which results in a working setup for SCO 5.0.
* support for ESCDELAY.
* small fixes for menu/form code.
* the test directory has its own configure.
* fixes to pads when optimizing scrolling.
* fixed several off-by-one bugs.
* fixes for termcap->terminfo translation; less restrictions more correct
  behavior.

### ncurses-1.9.7 -> 1.9.8a

* teach infocmp -i to recognize ECMA highlight sequences
* infocmp now dumps all SVr4 termcaps (not just the SVr4 ones) on -C
* support infocmp -RBSD.
* satisfy XSI Curses requirement that every macro be available as a function.
* This represents the last big change to the public interface of ncurses. The
  ABI_VERSION has now been set at 3.0 and should stay there barring any great
  catastrophies or acts of God.
* The C++ has been cleaned up in reaction to the changes to satisfy XSI's
  requirements.
* libncurses now gets linked to libcurses to help seamless emulation
  (replacement) of a vendor's curses. --disable-overwrite turns this behavior
  off.

### ncurses-1.9.6 -> 1.9.7

* corrected return values of setupterm()
* Fixed some bugs in tput (it does padding now)
* fixed a bug in tic that made it do the wrong thing on entries with more than
  one `use' capability.
* corrected the screen-size calculation at startup time to alter the
  numeric capabilities as per SVr4, not just LINES and COLS.
* toe(1) introduced; does what infocmp -T used to.
* tic(1) can now translate AIX box1 and font[0123] capabilities.
* tic uses much less core, the dotic.sh kluge can go away now.
* fix read_entry() and write_entry() to pass through cancelled capabilities OK.
* Add $HOME/.terminfo as source/target directory for terminfo entries.
* termcap compilation now automatically dumps an entry to $HOME/.terminfo.
* added -h option to toe(1).
* added -R option to tic(1) and infocmp(1).
* added fallback-entry-list feature.
* added -i option to infocmp(1).
* do a better job at detecting if we're on SCO.

### ncurses-1.9.5 -> 1.9.6

* handling of TERMCAP environment variables now works correctly.
* various changes to shorten termcap translations to less that 1024 chars.
* tset(1) added
* mouse support for xterm.
* most data tables are now const and accordingly live in shareable text space.
* Obey the XPG4/SVr4 practice that echo() is initally off.
* tic is much better at translating XENIX and AIX termcap entries now.
* tic can interpret ko capabilities now.
* integrated Juergen Pfeifer's forms library.
* taught write_entry() how not to write more than it needs to; this change
  reduces the size of the terminfo tree by a full 26%!
* infocmp -T option added.
* better warnings about historical tic quirks from tic.

### ncurses 1.9.4 -> 1.9.5

* menus library is now included with documentation.
* lib_mvcur has been carefully profiled and tuned.
* Fixed a ^Z-handling bug that was tanking lynx(1).
* HJ Lu's patches for ELF shared libraries under Linux
* terminfo.src 9.8.2
* tweaks for compiling in seperate directories.
* Thomas Dickey's patches to support NeXT's brain-dead linker
* Eric Raymond's patches to fix problems with long termcap entries.
* more support for shared libraries under SunOS and IRIX.

### ncurses 1.9.3 -> 1.9.4

* fixed an undefined-order-of-evaluation bug in lib_acs.c
* systematically gave non-API public functions and data an _nc_ prefix.
* integrated Juergen Pfeifer's menu code into the distribution.
* totally rewrote the knight test game's interface

### ncurses 1.9.2c -> 1.9.3

* fixed the TERMCAP_FILE Support.
* fixed off-by-one errors in scrolling code
* added tracemunch to the test tools
* took steps to cut the running time of make install.data

### ncurses 1.9.2c -> 1.9.2d

* revised 'configure' script to produce libraries for normal, debug,
  profile and shared object models.

### ncurses 1.9.1 -> 1.9.2

* use 'autoconf' to implement 'configure' script.
* panels support added
* tic now checks for excessively long termcap entries when doing translation
* first cut at eliminating namespace pollution.

### ncurses 1.8.9 -> 1.9

* cleanup gcc warnings for the following: use size_t where 'int' is not
  appropriate, fixed some shadowed variables, change attr_t to compatible with
  chtype, use attr_t in some places where it was confused with 'int'.
* use chtype/attr_t casts as appropriate to ensure portability of masking
  operations.
* added-back waddchnstr() to lib_addstr.c (it had been deleted).
* supplied missing prototypes in curses.h
* include <termcap.h> in lib_termcap.c to ensure that the prototypes
  are consistent (they weren't).
* corrected prototype of tputs in <termcap.h>
* rewrote varargs parsing in lib_tparm.c (to avoid referencing memory
  that may be out of bounds on the stack) -- Purify found this.
* ensure that TRACE is defined in lib_trace.c (to solve prototype
  warnings from gcc).
* corrected scrolling-region size in 'mvcur_wrap()'
* more spelling fixes
* use 'calloc()' to allocate WINDOW struct in lib_newwin.c (Purify).
* set default value for SP->_ofp in lib_set_term.c (otherwise SunOS dumps
  core in init_acs()).
* include <errno.h> in write_entry.c (most "braindead" includes declare errno
  in that file).

### ncurses 1.8.8 -> 1.8.9

* compile (mostly) clean with gcc 2.5.8 -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes
  -Wmissing-prototypes -Wconversion and using __attribute__ to flush out
  non-portable use of "%x" for pointers, or for chtype data (which is declared
  as a long).
* modified doupdate to ensure that typahead was turned on before attempting
  select-call (otherwise, some implementations hang).
* added trace mask TRACE_FIFO, use this in lib_getch.c to allow finer
  resolution of traces.
* improved bounds checking on several critical functions.
* the data directory has been replaced by the new master terminfo file.
* -F file-comparison option added to infocmp.
* compatibility with XSI Curses is now documented in the man bages.
* wsyncup/wsyncdown functions are reliable now; subwindow code in general
  is much less flaky.
* capabilities ~msgr, tilde_glitch, insert_padding, generic_type, no_pad_char,
  memory_above, memory_below, and hard_copy are now used properly.
* cursor-movement optimization has been completely rewritten.
* vertical-movement optimization now uses hardware scrolling, il, dl.

### ncurses 1.8.7 -> 1.8.8
* untic no longer exists, infocmp replaces it.
* tic can understand termcap now, especially if it is called captoinfo.
* The Linux Standard Console terminfo entry is called linux insead of console.
  It also uses the kernel's new method of changing charsets.
* initscr() will EXIT upon error (as the docs say) This wil mostly happen if
  you try to run on an undefined terminal.
* I can get things running on AIX but tic can't compile terminfo. I have to
  compile entries on another machine. Volunteers to hunt this bug are welcome.
* wbkgd() and wbkgdset() can be used to set a windows background to color.
  wclear()/werase() DO NOT use the current attribute to clear the screen.
  This is the way SVR4 curses works. PDCurses 2.1 is broken in this respect,
  though PDCurses 2.2 has been fixed.
* cleaned up the test/ directory.
* test/worm will segfault after quite a while.
* many spelling corrections courtesy of Thomas E. Dickey

### ncurses 1.8.6 -> 1.8.7
* cleaned up programs in test/ directory.
* fixed wbkgdset() macro.
* modified getstr() to stop it from advancing cursor in noecho mode.
* modified linux terminfo entry to work with the latest kernel to get
  the correct alternate character set.
* also added a linux-mono entry for those running on monochrome screens.
* changed initscr() so that it behaves like the man page says it does.
  this fixes the problem with programs in test/ crashing with SIGSEV if
  a terminal is undefined.
* modified addch() to avoid using any term.h #define's
* removed duplicate tgoto() in lib_tparm.c
* modified dump_entry.c so that infocmp deals correctly with ',' in acsc
* modified delwin() to correctly handle deleting subwindows.
* fixed Makefile.dist to stop installing an empty curses.h
* fixed a couple of out-of-date notes in man pages.

### ncurses 1.8.5 -> 1.8.6
* Implemented wbkgd(), bkgd(), bkgdset(), and wbkgdset().
* The handling of attributes has been improved and now does not turn off color
  if other attributes are turned off.
* scrolling code is improved. Scrolling in subwindows is still broken.
* Fixes to several bugs that manifest them on platforms other than Linux.
* The default to meta now depends on the status of the terminal when ncurses
  is started.
* The interface to the tracing facility has changed.  Instead of the pair of
  functions traceon() and traceoff(), there is just one function trace() which
  takes a trace mask argument.  The trace masks, defined in curses.h, are
  as follows:

	#define TRACE_DISABLE	0x00	/* turn off tracing */
	#define TRACE_ORDINARY	0x01	/* ordinary trace mode */
	#define TRACE_CHARPUT	0x02	/* also trace all character outputs */
	#define TRACE_MAXIMUM	0x0f	/* maximum trace level */

  More trace masks may be added, or these may be changed, in future releases.
* The pad code has been improved and the pad test code in test/ncurses.c has
  been improved.
* The prototype ansi entry has been changed to work with a wider variety
  of emulators.
* Fix to the prototype ansi entry that enables it to work with PC emulators
  that treat trailing ";m" in a highlight sequence as ";0m"; this doesn't
  break operation with any emulators.
* There are now working infocmp, captoinfo, tput, and tclear utilities.
* tic can now compile entries in termcap syntax.
* Core-dump bug in pnoutrefresh fixed.
* We now recognize and compile all the nonstandard capabilities in Ross
  Ridge's mytinfo package (rendering it obsolete).
* General cleanup and documentation improvements.
* Fixes and additions to the installation-documentation files.
* Take cursor to normal mode on endwin.

### ncurses 1.8.4 -> 1.8.5
* serious bugs in updating screen which caused erratic non-display,
  fixed.
* fixed initialization for getch() related variable which cause
  unpredictable results.
* fixed another doupdate bug which only appeared if you have
  parm_char.
* implemented redrawln() and redrawwin().
* implemented winsnstr() and related functions.
* cleaned up insertln() and deleteln() and implemented (w)insdeln().
* changed Makefile.dist so that installation of man pages will
  take note of the terminfo directory.
* fixed Configure (removed the mysterious 'X').
* Eric S. Raymond fixed the script.* files so that they work with
  stock awk.

#### ncurses 1.8.3 -> 1.8.4 #### ####
* fixed bug in refreshing the screen after return from shell_mode.
  There are still problems but they don't manifest themselves on
  my machine (Linux 0.99.14f).
* added wgetnstr() and modified things accordingly.
* fixed the script.src script.test to work with awk not just gawk.
* Configure can now take an argument of the target system.
* added test/ncurses.c which replaces several other programs and
  performs more testing.
[Thanks to Eric S Raymond for the last 4]
* more fixes to lib_overlay.c and added test/over.c to illustrate
  how it works.
* fixed ungetch() to take int instead of ch.
* fixes to cure wgetch() if flushinp() is called.

One note I forgot to mention in 1.8.3 is that tracing is off by
default starting in the version. If you want tracing output, put
traceon(); in your code and link with -ldcurses.

#### ncurses 1.8.2 -> ncurses 1.8.3 #### ####
MAJOR CHANGES:
1) The order of capabilities has been changed in order to achieve
binary compatibility with SVR4 terminfo database. This has the
unfortunate effect of breaking application currently linked with
ncurses. To ensure correct behavior, recompile all such programs.
Most programs using color or newer capabilities will break, others
will probably continue to work ok.

2) Pavel Curtis has renounced his copyright to the public domain.
This means that his original sources (posted to comp.sources.unix,
volume 1) are now in the public domain.  The current sources are
NOT in the public domain, they are copyrighted by me.  I'm
entertaining ideas on what the new terms ncurses is released under.

3) Eric S. Raymond has supplied a complete set of man pages for
ncurses in ?roff format. They will eventually replace most of the
current docs. Both sets are included in this release.

Other changes and notes from 1.8.2 include:
* SIGSEGV during scrolling no longer occurs.
* Other problems with scrolling and use of idl have been corrected.
* lib_getch.c has been re-written and should perform flawlessly.
  please use test/getch.c and any other programs to test this.
* ripoffline() is implemented (Thanks to Eric) and slk_ functions
  changed accordingly.
* I've added support for terminals that scroll if you write in the
  bottom-right corner.
* fixed more bugs in pads code. If anybody has a program that uses
  pads I'd love a copy.
* correct handling for terminal with back_color_erase capability
  (such as Linux console, and most PC terminals)
* ^Z handling apparently didn't work (I should never trust code
  sent me to me without extensive testing). It now seems to be
  fixed. Let me know if you have problems.
* I've added support for Apollo and NeXT, but it may still be
  incomplete, especially when dealing with the lack of POSIX
  features.
* scrolling should be more efficient on terminals with idl
  capabilities. Please see src/lib_scroll.c for more notes.
* The line drawing routines were offset by 1 at both ends. This
  is now fixed.
* added a few missing prototypes and macros (e.g. setterm())
* fixed code in src/lib_overlay.c which used to crash.
* added a few more programs in test/ The ones from the PDCurses
  package are useful, especially if you have SVR4 proper. I'm
  interested in the results you get on such a systems (Eric? ;-).
  They already exposed certain bugs in ncurses.
* See src/README for porting notes.
* The C++ code should really replace ncurses.h instead of working
  around it. It should avoid name-space clashes with nterm.h (use
  rows instead of lines, etc.)
* The C++ should compile ok. I've added explicit rules to the
  Makefile because no C++ defaults are documented on the suns.
* The docs say that echo() and nocbreak() are mutually exclusive.
  At the moment ncurses will switch to cbreak() if the case above
  occurs. Should it continue to do so? How about echo() and noraw()?
* PDCurses seem to assume that wclear() will use current attribute
  when clearing the screen. According to Eric this is not the case
  with SVR4.
* I have discovered, to my chagrin, SunOS 4.x (and probably other systems)
  * doesn't have vsscanf and God knows what else!  I've will do a vsscanf().
* I've also found out that the src/script.* rely on gawk and will not
  work with stock awk or even with nawk. Any changes are welcome.
* Linux is more tolerant of NULL dereferences than most systems. This
  fact was exposed by hanoi.
* ncurses still seems inefficient in drawing the screen on a serial
  link between Linux and suns. The padding may be the culprit.
* There seems to be one lingering problem with doupdate() after shelling
  out. Despite the fact the it is sending out the correct information
  to the terminal, nothing takes effect until you press ^L or another
  refresh takes place. And yes, output does get flushed.

#### ncurses 1.8.1 -> ncurses 1.8.2 #### Nov 28, 1993 ####

* added support for SVR4 and BSDI's BSD/386.
* major update and fix to scrolling routine.
* MORE fixes to stuff in lib_getch.c.
* cleaned-up configuration options and can now generate
	Config.* files through an awk script.
* changed setupterm() so it can be called more than once,
	add added set_curterm(), del_curterm().
* a few minor cleanups.
* added more prototypes in curses.h

#### ncurses 1.8 -> ncurses 1.8.1 #### Nov 4, 1993 ####

* added support for NeXTStep 3.0
* added termcap emulation (not well tested).
* more complete C++ interface to ncurses.
* fixed overlay(), overwrite(), and added copywin().
* a couple of bug fixes.
* a few code cleanups.

#### ncurses 0.7.2/0.7.3 -> ncurses 1.8 #### Aug 31, 1993 ####

* The annoying message "can't open file." was due to missing
  terminfo entry for the used terminal. It has now been
  replaced by a hopefully more helpful message.
* Problems with running on serial lines are now fixed.
* Added configuration files for SunOS, Linux, HP/UX, Ultrix,
  386bsd/BSDI (if you have others send'em to me)
* Cleaner Makefile.
* The documentation in manual.doc is now more uptodate.
* update optimization and support for hp terminals, and 386bsd
  console driver(s).
* mvcur optimization for terminals without cursor addressing
  (doesn't work on Linux)
* if cursor moved since last update, getch() will refresh the
  screen before working.
* getch() & alarm() can now live together. in 0.7.3 a signal
  interrupted getch() (bug or feature?) now the getch is
  restarted.
* scanw() et all were sick, now fixed.
* support for 8-bit input (use meta()).
* added default screen size to all terminfos.
* added c++ Ncursesw class.
* several minor bug fixes.

#### ncurses 0.7.2 -> ncurses 0.7.3 #### May 27, 1993 ####

* Config file to cope with different platforms (386BSD, BSDI, Ultrix, SunOS)
* more fixes to lib_getch.c
* changes related to Config

#### ncurses 0.7 -> ncurses 0.7.2 #### May 22, 1993 ####

* docs updated slightly (color usage is now documented).
* yet another fix for getch(), this one fixes problems with ESC being swallowed
  if another character is typed before the 1 second timeout.
* Hopefully, addstr() and addch() are 8-bit clean.
* fixed lib_tparm.c to use stdarg.h (should run on suns now)
* order of capabilities changed to reflect that specified in SYSV
  this will allow for binary-compatibility with existing terminfo dbs.
* added halfdelay()
* fixed problems with asc_init()
* added A_PROTECT and A_INVIS
* cleaned up vidputs()
* general cleanup of the code
* more attention to portability to other systems
* added terminfos for hp70092 (wont work until changes to lib_update.c are
  made) and 386BSD pcvt drivers.

Thanks to Hellmuth Michaelis for his help.
optimization code is slated for the next major release, stay tuned!

#### ncurses 0.6/0.61 -> ncurses 0.7 #### April 1, 1993
Please note that the next release will be called 1.8. If you want to know about
the rationale drop me a line.

Included are several test programs in test/.
I've split up the panels library, reversi, tetris, sokoban. They are now
available separately from netcom.com:pub/zmbenhal/

* color and ACS support is now fully compatible with SYSV at the terminfo
  level.
* Capabilities now includes as many SYSV caps I could find.

* boolnames, boolfnames, boolcodes numnames, numfnames, numcodes,
  strnames, strfnames, strcodes arrays are now added.
* keyname() is added.
* All function keys can be defined in terminfo entries.
* fixed lin_tparm.c to behave properly.
* terminfo entries for vt* and xterm are included (improvements are welcome)
* more automation in handling caps and keys.
* included fixes from 0.6.1
* added a few more missing functions.
* fixed a couple of minor bugs.
* updated docs JUST a little (still miles behind in documenting the newer

#### ncurses 0.6 -> ncurses 0.61 ####

1) Included the missing data/console.

2) allow attributes when drawing boxes.

3) corrected usage of win->_delay value.

4) fixed a bug in lib_getch.c. if it didn't recognize a sequence it would
	simply return the last character in the sequence. The correct
	behavior is to return the entire sequence one character at a time.

#### ncurses0.5 -> ncurses0.6 #### March 1, 1993 ####
* removed _numchngd from struct _win_st and made appropriate changes.
* rewritten kgetch() to remove problems with interaction between alarm and
  read(). It caused SIGSEGV every now and then.
* fixed a bug that miscounted the numbers of columns when updating.
  (in lib_doupdate.c(ClrUpdate() -- iterate to columns not columns-1)
* fixed a bug that cause the lower-right corner to be incorrect.
  (in lib_doupdate.c(putChar() -- check against columns not columns-1)
* made resize() and cleanup() static to lib_newterm.c
* added notimeout().
* added timeout() define in curses.h
* added more function prototypes and fixed napms.
* added use_env().
* moved screen size detection to lib_setup.c.
* fixed newterm() to confirm to prototype.
* removed SIGWINCH support as SYSV does not define its semantics.
* cleaned-up lib_touch.c
* added waddnstr() and relatives.
* added slk_* support.
* fixed a bug in wdeleteln().
* added PANEL library.
* modified Makefile for smoother installation.
* terminfo.h is really term.h

#### ncurses 0.4 -> ncurses 0.5 #### Feb 14, 1993 ####
* changed _win_st structure to allow support for missing functionality.
* Addition of terminfo support for all KEY_*.
* Support for nodelay(), timeout(), notimeout().
* fixed a bug with the keypad char reading that did not return ESC until
  another key is pressed.
* nl mapping no longer occur on output (as should be)
  fixed bug '\n' no causing a LF.
* fixed bug that reset terminal colors regardless of whether we use color
  or not.
* Better support for ACS (not quite complete).
* fixed bug in wvline().
* added curs_set().
* changed from signal() to sigaction().
* re-included the contents of important.patch into source.

#### ncurses 0.3 -> ncurses 0.4 #### Feb 3, 1993 ####
* Addition of more KEY_* definitions.
* Addition of function prototypes.
* Addition of several missing functions.
* No more crashes if screen size is undefined (use SIGWINCH handler).
* added a handler to cleanup after SIGSEGV (hopefully never needed).
* changed SRCDIR from /etc/term to /usr/lib/terminfo.
* renamed compile/dump to tic/untic.
* New scrolling code.
* fixed bug that reversed the sense of nl() and nonl().

#### ncurses 0.2 -> ncurses 0.3  #### Jan 20, 1993 ####
* more support for color and graphics see test/ for examples.
* fixed various files to allow correct update after shelling out.
* more fixes for updates.
* no more core dumps if you don't have a terminfo entry.
* support for LINES and COLUMNS environment variables.
* support for SIGWINCH signal.
* added a handler for SIGINT for clean exits.

#### ncurses 0.1 -> ncurses 0.2 #### Aug 14, 1992 ####
* support for color.
* support for PC graphic characters.
* lib_trace.c updated to use stdarg.h and vprintf routines.
* added gdc.c (Great Digital Clock) as an example of using color.

#### ncurses -> ncurses 0.1 #### Jul 31, 1992 ####
* replacing sgtty stuff by termios stuff.
* ANSIfication of some functions.
* Disabling cost analysis 'cause it's incorrect.
* A quick hack for a terminfo entry.
