.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Urlget
gets a file specified by a URL and copies it to standard output.

.B Ftpget
similarly gets a file from a conventional ftp server, a login name
and password can be specified.
If a slash is appended to the path, a directory listing is performed
instead of a file transfer.

.B Ftpput
transfers a file to an ftp server, a login name and password can be specified.

is similar to  urlget,  but  the  host  and  path  are  specified
separately without a scheme, as with ftpget.
