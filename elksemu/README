Elksemu is an emulator for the environment that elks will provide on a
real ELKS machine. The emulator only runs on linux-i386 or similar.

If you're using a 2.0.36, 2.1.43, 2.2.0 or later kernel then the
binfmt_misc driver is in the stock kernel and all you need to do is
add the following line into the relevent /etc/rc* file.

echo ':i86-elks:M::\x01\x03\x20\x00:\xff\xff\xff\x83:/usr/bin/elksemu:' \
     > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register

Note, however, if binfmt_misc is compiled as a module it will not auto
load so you will have to do this manually. 

If your kernel version is 1.2.13 then apply the patch in the Kernel_patch
file. 

If you're using one of the other 2.0.X series then the binfmt_elks.c module
should be able to compile and install. BUT do note you need the modules
and probably modversions options and you _may_ have to alter the compile
command to match those seen when you compile modules that come with the
kernel.
