	* Added patch to docs files, and scripts.
	* Added David Murns patch to add support for MS-DOS EXEs, only
	  partially implemented yet. Also a few other simple patches,
	  including a new top level target in the Makefile, called boot
	  which creates a boot image for dosemu.
	* Added patch by Patrick LAM to fix inode corruption bug. Kernel
	  is now much more stable.

	  s.weijgers@net.HCC.nl.
	* Added Alastair Bridgewater's protected mode code which does not
	  work correctly yet, but is included for reference.
	* Sorted out arch/i86/include as a symlink to include/arch, and
	  cleaned out a few old files.

	* Fixed partition code so that it is included. Renamed BIOS HD
	  devices from hda.. to bda..
	* Put in patch by Michael.Mueller4@post.rwth-aachen.de that fixes
	  scroll echoeing in the console driver.
	* Changed some of the irq code so that if CONFIG_XT is specified,
	  only support for 8 IRQs is compiled in.
	* Fixed bug with initialisation of first_inode in fs/inode.c.
	* See comments in mount_root() in fs/super.c for details of a bug
	  I have not been able to find, which causes the kernel to lock up.
	* Added new kernel/signal.c with the start of the sys_kill code.
	  (Work in progress)

VERSION 0.0.69 NOTES
--------------------

	* Added Blaz Antonics directhd driver which currently supports IDE
	  drives. This code is untested. Do not use it on a disk you cannot
	  afford to lose.
	* Added Erik ???'s patch to the console driver for hercules cards,
	  and two other small fixes, on which disables memorycheck on
	  C-A-D.
	* Added Rob de Baths patch which allows a single boot/root floppy
	  to work.

VERSION 0.0.69-pre2 NOTES
-------------------------

	* Fixed syscall calls so they no longer corrupt si and di.
	* Changed kernel code so it makes heavy use of register variables
	  for pointers. The has reduced the size of the kernel by more
	  than 3K.
	* Changed code again so register is now used on function
	  parameters. The kernel is now a futher 3k smaller.
	* Removed some more unused code from the filesystem.

VERSION 0.0.69-pre1 NOTES
-------------------------

	* Added support to mem char device for a ps command to read the
	  data structures from kernel memory.
	* Fixed a bug in the default lseek that was causing mkfs to break.
	* Fixed a really evil bug in wait4. Shells may now work.
	* Fixed inw.
	* Changed terminal ioctls to POSIX version.
	* Added patch to Makefiles to allow optimisation flags to be
	  included.
	* Added support for foreign keyboard layouts - this is not yet
	  entirely correct as I don not have access to all keyboards. If
	  you spot a problem with your keyboard, please report it.
	* Fixed terminal code to accept <CTRL>-D.
	* Patched build.c so it can now build kernels of Sparc, and
	  hopefully other non Intel endian processors.

VERSION 0.0.68 NOTES
--------------------

	* Most of the timer bugs should now be gone.
	* Fixed reported number of harddrives.
	* Put in select code as converted from Linux by Patrick Lam.
	* Made a change to malloc code to remove hole[1], which is below
	  the kernel code in RAM. Now all user memory is above the kernel.
	  This patch as described by Alan Cox removed his occurence of the
	  timer bug..
	* Added the stack backtrace to panic, and the code to redirect the
	  kernel if it gets restarted - no more cryptic "unable to get
	  timer". Removed old verbose code from irq.c. Patch submitted by
	  Jay Kulpinski.
	* Put in support for TCGETA and TCSETA ioctls in the tty code.
	* Fixed small bug in irq.c that reported the irq pointer for
	  unexpected irqs instead of the irq number.
	* Re-wrote some of the code that manages copying to and from user
	  space. Some code reduced. New verified_memcpy...() functions now
	  used instead of using verify_area() separatly.
	* Added Blaz Antonic's new more generic probing code for floppies.
	  Got rid of the bufseg parameter to save space.
	* Added and fixed Blaz Antonics changes to lp driver so it now
	  uses the BIOS to find out where the ports are.
	* #ifdefd out the immediate bottom half and its run queue as
	  nothing uses it.
	* Removed some redundant code from schedule().
	* Cut down ll_rw_block so it only handles single block requests,
	  which is okay, as this is all it was doing anyway. Cut out lots
	  of other code related to request. Code now panics if it can't
	  get a request.
	* #ifdefd out the task queue code as nothing was using it.
	* Added some support to tty code for non canonical mode, and
	  non-echoing mode. Currently minimal support for vi only.

VERSION 0.0.68-pre5 NOTES
-------------------------

	* This really should fix at least one problem now. (The last one
	  didn't work because of a typo).

VERSION 0.0.68-pre4 NOTES
-------------------------

	* Another very small change to arch/i86/lib/bitops.c.

VERSION 0.0.68-pre3 NOTES
-------------------------

	* Very small change to arch/i86/lib/bitops.c to put back in the
	  old code.

VERSION 0.0.68-pre2 NOTES
-------------------------

	* Integrated Shane Kerr's time code patch. This may solve the
	  timer bug.

VERSION 0.0.68-pre1 NOTES
-------------------------

	* Removed lots of code from fs using the BLOAT_FS #ifdef.
	* Fixed infinite loop in buffer.c.
	* Added base level socket code.
	* Changed code that uses save_flags/restore_flags so they use an
	  int instead of a long, and saved several bytes!!
	* Fixed bug in lp.c pointed out by Patrick Lam.
	* Re-sorted the code that deals with timer. Timer is now stopped,
	  the table is initialised, the irq is requested, then the timer
	  is started.
	* Added code so that BIOS irq 0 routine is called every five ELKS
	  interrupts (100Hz). The means BIOS is called at 20HZ which is
	  close to the 18.2Hz that the BIOS needs.
	* Removed references to need_resched and can_tswitch as they are
	  currently unused by the scheduler.
	* Removed redundant code from do_fork(). Added panic to find_hole
	  as all code that called find_hole panics if it returns NULL.
	  Added code so that split_hole checks hole is too big to reduce
	  wasted code elsewhere.
	* Cleaned up some excessive boot time messages, mostly from doshd.
	* Put workaround for compiler bug in the end of init_task().

VERSION 0.0.67 NOTES
--------------------

	* Changed Makfile to make include dependencies location
	  independant.
	* Fixed floppy.c so that it it is configured in there is no link
	  error.
	* Fixed bug in fs/buffer.c which was making get_free_buffer() wait
	  indefinitly and corrupting the filesystem.
	* Added Rob de Bath's patch to force use of syscall.dat.
	* Added Blaz Antonic's lp driver. Tweaked it to make it more
	  compact, and fix errors.
	* Added module code.
	* Fixed problem with ioctl trying to return long int.
	* Fixed kernel include file in linuxmt/ and arch/ directories so
	  they can be linked to from /usr/bcc/include, and bcc will still
	  work.
	* Changed tty code to speed up and remove redundant code and
	  arguments.
	* Added required irq's to irq table code and removed useless
	  unimplemented ones.
	* Took unused field Console.InUse out of the direct console code.
	* Added CONFIG_DCON_VT52 to allow VT52 console support to be left
	  out to save space.
	* Removed several functions from lib/string.c to save space.
	* Added Shane Kerr's patch to implement time functions.
	* Fixed backspace with <TAB> bug
	* Added heavy debugging output to try and solve the "unable to get
	  timer" panic problem.

VERSION 0.0.66 NOTES
--------------------

	* Removed unused functions print_bufmap_status(), refile_buffer(),
	  set_writetime() taska(), taskb(), interruptible_sleep_on(),
	  sys_uname(), sys_sethostname(), GetQueue(), SetLeds(),
	  get_request_wait(), and unused global variables busy[] busy_wait
	  force_bioshd blksize_size[] read_ahead[] and hardsect_size[].
	* Fixed rs_probe() so serial ports are now correctly probed, and
	  started work on a full serial tty driver. Written interupt
	  service routine, + routine to receive character into the chq.
	  Writing to serial now works, but the interrupt service routine
	  required for reads is currently not called when characters are
	  sent. Why anyone?
	* Altered tty code so that tty driver inserts \r before \n, rather
	  than it being done in the console and serial drivers directly.
	  If anyone thinks this is the wrong way round, please let me
	  know, together with your reasons.
	* Implemented Blaz Antonics change to speed up floppy probe.
	* Added code to doshd_release() so that floppy changes don't cause
	  corruption from old buffers.
	* Small change to stack_check() %d changed to %ld for t_endbrk.
	* Implemented Rob. de Bath changes for Dev86v13.
	* Added a simple ramdisk driver which can access up to 8 64K
	  ramdisks. See Documentation/ramdisk.txt.
	* Re-organised the way the debugging macros work, so they now have
	  paramater numbers. This cut out 2656 bytes of initialised data.

	PATCHES BY Matthew Kirkwood (weejock@ferret.lmh.ox.ac.uk)

	* I am going through these implementing one at a time as they are
	  against an old version.
	* Patch to crt1.c to cope with the possibility of an odd number of
	  bytes in kernel BSS.
	* Added Memory character device to support /dev/zero, /dev/null
	  and /dev/full. This has been fixed by me so it now works.
	* New faster version of find_first_zero_bit().
	* Other small cosemetic or code reduction changes.

VERSION 0.0.65 NOTES
--------------------

	* Clean up patch to doshd.c by Blaz Antonic. Fix bug in the
	  dma_avail code.
	* Add CONFIG_FS_RO config option which allows all filesystem write
	  code to be removed from the kernel, making root mount read-only
	  and saving huge ammounts of kernel space.
	* Removed unused syscalls truncate(2) ftruncate(2) statfs(2)
	  utimes(2)
	* Added the doshd.c patch adding ioctl GETGEOM to support fdisk,
	  by David Murn.
	* Fixed sys_ioctl() so that ioctl now works correctly. fdisk now
	  reads partition tables correctly on my test machine, but I
	  cannot currently test its writing capability.
	* Added Blaz Antonic's second patch which properlly fixes
	  autoprobing, especially for 1.2Mb drive users, and adds the
	  capability to hard code floppy type.
	* Add CONFIG_XT option, which currently does nothing.

VERSION 0.0.65pre1 (patch release) NOTES
----------------------------------------

	* Very quick and easy two line patch to fix floppy autoprobe.

VERSION 0.0.64 NOTES
--------------------

	* Further fixes and code reduction to block_dev.c.
	* Fixed the way the system_utsname structure is implemented. Now
	  no files should use the information in version.h, but should
	  instead use the appropriate entry in system_utsname.
	* Added two new configure options so that floppy or HDD code can
	  be left out of doshd.c, the BIOS device driver.
	* Re-integrated Chad Page's patch to doshd.c which was introduced
	  in 62 but left out of 63, with a bug fix which solves the
	  problems caused when an XT pretends it is an AT.
	* #if'd out some unused code in doshd.c (revalidate function) to
	  save about 400 bytes, added #ifdef's for the floppy and HDD
	  options.
	* Removing HDD support frees up 2K of code space!!
	* Minor bug fixes in fs code involving map_buffer()/unmap_buffer()
	  use.

VERSION 0.0.64-pre1 (internal) NOTES
------------------------------------

	* Fixed bug in FULL_VFS support (second try, lost 1st one). The
	  filesystem type check in sys_mount uses a local type string now.
	  Needed for get_fs_type.
	* Changed wait_for_keypress to blocking. Fixes PRESS RETURN in
	  mounting root during boot.
	* Integrated my patches based on 0.0.63pre1 with final release for
	  0.0.63
	* Further ported ROMFS, compiles and mounts.. though still not
	  useable.

VERSION 0.0.63 NOTES
--------------------

	* Some tweaks to make config including adding help.
	* Removed the following functions with "#if 0..": fstrlen,
	  puf_fs_word, print_tasks, sys_ni_syscall, sys_setregid,
	  sys_setreuid, sys_getpgid, sys_getpgrp, sys_getsid,
	  sys_setgroups, sys_getgroups, sys_uname, sys_sethostname,
	  sys_gethostname, get_chrfops, unregister_blkdev,
	  unregister_chrdev, as none of them were implemented. This
	  reduces the kernel code by 2000 bytes.
	* Removed about 150 bytes of code which did nothing from
	  cp_stat(). See comments for details

VERSION 0.0.63-pre3 (internal) NOTES
------------------------------------

	* Integrated pre1 patch into main kernel sources so make config,
	  multiple filesystem support, and the beginnings of romfs are now
	  there.
	* Remove lock_buffer() function and replace with inline code as it
	  is only used once.
	* Remove size parameter from bread() and getblk() as for both
	  functions size is always 1024, and cannot be anything else. This
	  saves about 300 bytes. Also remove paramater from find_buffer()
	  and get_hash_table().
	* Large changes to blk_rw() to make file access to block devices
	  work Bugs were caused because the function misused the bh_data
	  field of a buffer bh_data is only a valid pointer AFTER
	  map_buffer() has been called. This code has been tested slightly
	  and appears to work.

VERSION 0.0.63-pre2 (internal) NOTES
------------------------------------

	* Backed off change made to arch/i86/kernel/bios16.c as it caused
	  setup data to be corrupted.
	* Backed off change made to arch/i86/drivers/block/doshd.c as the
	  new code did not work on any test machines. Code is now very
	  similar to pre0.0.61A.

VERSION 0.0.63-pre1 NOTES
-------------------------

	* Added the make config to the kernel tree. It should allow easier
	  configuration of the kernel.
	* Did some cleanups/preparations for multiple filesystem support
	  and root devices other than minixfs.
	* Started porting ROMFS from linux to ELKS. It is in a very
	  premature state, meaning, it doesn't link yet.

VERSION 0.0.62 NOTES
--------------------

	* There are some slight kernel tweaks, although the main diff. is
	  that the rootdisk now uses Alastair J. Riddoch's userland
	  sources. Note that there is a data segment corruption bug that
	  hits the init code, so this kernel can be considered buggy.

VERSION pre0.0.61A NOTES
-------------------------

	* This is a bug-fixed version of 0.0.59, and should be the most
	  stable kernel yet[*]. It turned out the multitasking bug was a
	  feedback bug in the console driver which only crops up in VC's,
	  so commented that out and fixed things up a bit. Also, after
	  every read/write schedule() is called to make sure multitasking
	  is quite smooth.

		[* - Okay, it's not *that* stable :) ]

	* I still haven't tested it outside of dosemu, so YMMV... :)

VERSION 0.0.59 NOTES
--------------------

	(crunch)

	* The sound you just heard was ELKS' memory requirements (not code
	  size) being scrunched. Without init, you can now run sash and
	  small utilities like 'cat' in 256K of memory, and a whole lotta
	  sashes in 384K. (Note that that may go up 32-48K in .60 though,
	  if I implement kernel stacks outside of DS)
	* What I did was put the setup.S stuff and the 2-sector buffer for
	  doshd lower in the first 64K, and open up about 48K below the
	  kernel loading area.
	* I also implemented shared code segments, and a VERY crude
	  version of chmem. (found in elkscmd/chmem. It's really really
	  terse though :)
	* Also, it turned out that the kernel was functional with 1K
	  kernel stacks, so I was able to shrink that down and set the
	  process limit to 16.
	* I also put in L Saku's memmove patch (thanks for the quick
	  response!) - there are still a few speed opts I'd like to get
	  in, but I wanted to get 0.0.59 out quickly (especially after
	  trying to get outside kernel stacks working, which turned out to
	  be futile.)
	* Also, thanks to James Wells for pruning the directory tree...

VERSION 0.0.58 NOTES
--------------------

	* What a release... there are so many changes I don't think I can
	  remember them all! The kernel is a lot more stressed now BTW
	  (more processes, more memory use, etc) so there may be more
	  crashes. However, for the same tasks I think .58 is more stable
	  because of a couple of major bug fixes.
	* VC support now mostly works - some MDA support added but there's
	  a screen garbage problem right now, so it's not too useful. The
	  init/login sources that Alastair Riddoch (sp - it's late :) have
	  been changed to use all three virtual consoles! (Yes, you can
	  now have 3 logins on an XT :)
	* I've banged on the doshd and fs code to make hard disks and
	  larger (in terms of files) partitions usable. (I don't like the
	  inode.c hack though).
	* I've fixed the mount code to make it work for now, although I'm
	  going to reorganize the code in the libraries and remove the
	  mount type from it.
	* The timer is no longer set to 100 times/sec, because I suspect
	  that might have been causing some floppy timing problems on some
	  systems (no confirmation though, and it can be turned back on)
	  I've also 'covered up' all of the error messages unless it's hit
	  MAX_RETRYS.
	* In arch/i86/kernel/system.h, replaced hard coded 640K with a
	  check in the setup block.
	* Whoops! wait4 can only have three parameters, and we only use
	  status anyway :)
	* This is pretty much the feature set I intend for 0.01, with a
	  couple of more features added. There's a lot of fine-tuning left
	  to be done before then, since it's now a bit more ambitious than
	  before (i.e. more features :)

VERSION 0.0.57a (internal) NOTES			4/22/97 12:10AM
--------------------------------

	* Ayeee... I did a lot of hacking tonight :) I worked on the tty
	  layer some more (still not done, but we now handle output too),
	  and in the process of debugging things found a 'better' way to
	  do the queue stuff (instead of having a head and tail, we now
	  have head and length. This was *much* easier to implement :)
	* Combined with some other cuts, .57a is pretty close to .57 in
	  size, which is nice. My worry right now is about how much the
	  queue stuff will affect performance on an XT - I think I can
	  counter it, but then I'll be worried about how much space the
	  changes will take (I can't win!)
	* I've fine-tuned sash to use less stack and memory, so it should
	  be much more stable now.
	* Added CAD stuff to keyboard.c, but untested on virtue of it
	  being 12:30AM last night :) (.58 note: I don't think it works,
	  but you can try the /bin/reboot program out!)

VERSION 0.0.57 NOTES
--------------------

	* Started work on the tty driver - backspace actually works now! I
	  haven't done anything with the arrow stuff yet, since I need to
	  figure out the best way to deal with them (the keyboard driver
	  already converts it to VT52 escape sequences - I suspect
	  handling those is readline's job) There's a lot of work left to
	  be done on the driver though, and the output interface hasn't
	  even been touched yet!
	* Interestingly enough the rewrite actually made things a few
	  hundred bytes smaller - a non-strace kernel is ~63,900 bytes
	  now, although that'll grow when ntty.c is fleshed out more.
	* I also hacked up sash a bit more - the crashes involving vfork
	  were caused by using the system() library call which uses
	  vfork() which dosen't exist (I tried to implement it, but
	  couldn't get it right darnit!)
	* I also found a whopper bug in the minix/namei.c stuff... name
	  comparisons weren't being handled right (comparing R to RELNOTES
	  matched for instance) I fixed this with a 2-line hack to
	  namecompare (assuming that the files can't match if the name of
	  the file on-disk isn't null-terminated at the same place the
	  other name is :)

VERSION 0.0.56 NOTES
--------------------

	* Lotsa bug fixes, but there are still a lot more to be done.
	* Fixed sash 'bug' in cp which made it overrun it's stack (it
	  allocated 8,192 bytes - okay in regular Linux but not here :)
	* Implemented stack checking (relative to current bss) whenever a
	  syscall is made. Shouldn't slow things down *too* much, since
	  it's a very short routine. If the stack grows too long, sys_exit
	  is called immediately to kill the process.
	* stat() now sets the file size properly (it didn't copy it over)  
	* ls in sash now prints sizes properly.
	* Wrote a six-line implementation of sys_rename. It probably
	  doesn't do it the right way, but we don't have space to write
	  another big function or two... :) So, I decided to just call
	  sys_link and if that works sys_unlink the old file.
	* sys_vfork has been mapped to do_fork. I don't think this works
	  right. (If the parameters are long enough, sash chooses to do
	  vfork!)

   TODO:  Change the stat+inode stuff to match to save code space)

VERSION 0.0.55 NOTES
--------------------

	* The drivers directory has been rolled into the arch/ directory,
	  and I've started work on paring down the kernel to run under DOS
	  (it'll be released when it's done :)
	* I've made some tweaks to the keyboard driver, which makes it a
	  bit more like a real tty (although backspaces still aren't
	  handled right)
	* sash is now the default shell... I've mostly gotten it to work
	  (added a few fflush-es & stuff) Hopefully we can use this to
	  figure out everything else that's borken :)

VERSION 0.0.54 NOTES
--------------------

	* The fmemcpy routine is now in assembler, and makes the entire
	  kernel *MUCH* faster on my test IBM XT! fork is now much faster,
	  and '/bin/cat RELNOTES' is much faster and more even now.
	* I worked on mkdir() some - it's not finished but it won't cause
	  a panic anymore :)
	* I added a print_regs() function which safely prints out all
	  current registers (except ss), so we can check what the
	  registers are just before we have a failure.

VERSION 0.0.53(.1) NOTES
------------------------

	* I've put together a usable version of sys_brk() so malloc in
	  libc will now work correctly. As a result the POSIX-style
	  readdir() routines now work. minish (not uptodate with what
	  Stephan has done) has been changed to work with the `new' libc
	  readdir functions...
	* I also fixed the doshd.c bug, and ELKS now works on 360K disks
	  again. (I suspect the bug predates bug reports though). Instead
	  of going to the next track/head it was going back one sector,
	  which was bad.
	* If you don't know already, this release is meant to install
	  over/into Dev86 0.0.11, so if you haven't gotten it already *get
	  it now!!!* To get everything working you have to unpack Dev86,
	  then unpack elks, build the (slightly-modified) Dev86, and then
	  build the kernel with it. This is done so that you don't have to
	  manually change dev86, and it dosen't really change anything
	  except the libc/syscall directory and the rules.86 file.
	* minish unpacks into the tests/ directory, along with a new
	  makefile.
	* Optimization is turned off, since there appears to be something
	  else wrong with it.

VERSION 0.0.52copt1 NOTES
-------------------------

	* This is identical to 0.0.52, except that the makefiles are
	  changed to use bccopt. The kernel is 1300 bytes smaller, and
	  should be faster as well as a lot of the instructions optimized
	  out are redundant.
	* A new rootdisk image is provided so that you can check out the
	  effects of the optimization.
	* Special thanks to Gero who rewrote/fixed the copt optimizer to
	  make it work effectively with bcc!

VERSION 0.0.52 NOTES
--------------------

	(Note: the kernel looks for /bin/sh rather than /sbin/init!)

	* I have a very simplistic group of readdir functions in here.
	  They're not finely-tuned, but they work with the minish which is
	  included. They're not POSIX-compliant either, and I'll probably
	  work on a different interface (don't expect open/closedir in
	  0.0.53) for future versions.
	* do_exec() now corrects the pre-built stack so parameters are
	  passed correctly (minish can now call programs with
	  parameters...) I tried to do execve, but I didn't get it to work
	  right before my patience ran out, and it added 3-400 bytes to
	  the code anyway :)
	* I also tweaked a couple of things in the fs/* - sb->s_flags is
	  now 16-bit, and I did a little bit of tightening in
	  fs/inode.c... the next thing will be to exorcise inode.c's hash
	  tables.
	* Special thanks to Christoph for the new memcpy_*fs routines, and
	  Stephan for the enhanced version of minish.c which I worked on
	  for Linux/8086 0.0.52.
	* Don't forget to copy the files in linux.86/patches/libc.syscall
	  to your libc's syscall directory, and rebuild your libc again...
	  be ready to do it for 0.0.53 too :)

VERSION 0.0.51 NOTES
--------------------

	* This version includes the first version of minish, the "World's
	  Smallest Shell" It executes what you tell it to do, and that's
	  about all it can do... basically it's to test the ability of
	  fork/exec/wait/exit at this point, and it took a while to get
	  the kernel to do *that* right...
	* I had to implement sys_exit() and sys_wait4() (barely), and I'm
	  not sure I got exit right, and I really don't have wait4 right
	  at all (it only remembers 1 exited process!)
	* Also, in the next kernel series (0.1.x or 0.2.x), I'm
	  considering rewriting some parts in assembler, which would
	  replace the C versions if they exist... the kernel is now about
	  65,050 bytes, which is Way Too Big if we want to put things like
	  signals in here...

VERSION 0.0.50 NOTES
--------------------

	* File writes (at least sequential ones) now work! There are still
	  a couple of bugs that I don't like (file permissions aren't set
	  right, etc), but writing now seems to work correctly (after
	  fixing quite a few bugs)
	* The bitmap code is quite different now, mostly because I thought
	  it was buggy because of another problem (I wish bcc checked
	  types going into functions...)
	* There are still quite a few bugs to fix, but hopefully the file
	  write feature will be useful.
	* I changed the code on the rootdisk to read /sbin/ txtfile and
	  write it to /newfile. This appears to work okay except the file
	  permissions are wrong, and it will perpetually be unchecked
	  afterwards (those were 'minor' bugs to me, compared to how many
	  there were before :)

VERSION pre-0.0.50 (not released) NOTES 
---------------------------------------

	* I've been working on the file write code (which was completely
	  borken before). I had to write the find_first_zero routine,
	  which I'm not even totally sure works right, but looks okay. To
	  get this far, I had to overcome what appeared to be compounding
	  bugs.
	* I've fixed enough bugs so that it *looks* from the kernel
	  standpoint that everything's okay. There were quite a few bugs -
	  I'll see if I can't make a diff so I can list them all! Right
	  now the directory code still looks broken.
	* At this point I'd like to say 'thank goodness for dosemu and
	  disk images!' - if it weren't for those I'd probably have had a
	  much tougher time getting this far.
	* BTW, make clean the kernel after changing the strace option.
	  process.c does not recompile for some reason after changing it.
	  Should fix that for 0.0.50...

VERSION 0.0.49a NOTES
---------------------

	* This pretty much does what I said I'd do for 0.0.50, but
	  something tells me that I haven't done enough to bump up the
	  version number...
	* doshd now reads/writes from 0x0800:0x0000 (in other words, 32K
	  :) I also am now loading setup at 8K, assuming that it won't get
	  overwritten there. If I've screwed up here, I'm gonna have to
	  think of something else though.
	* The keyboard_read() routine has been optimized a bit and moved
	  into xt_key.c. Still no wouldblock or ^C handling of any sort
	  though.

VERSION 0.0.49 NOTES
--------------------

	* Keyboard support should now REALLY work, since I was able to
	  make xt_key.c and dircon.c work together. I tested it under my
	  P/133 with and without dosemu, and on a 5150... it will
	  hopefully work on most other systems now.
	* 'non-blocking I/O' is not handled differently than regular I/O
	  yet though, and wait queues for good multitasking aren't
	  implemented yet. That's for 0.0.50 :)
	* Also, I changed the way buffers are unmapped so that in a
	  straight file read, the indirect block and the file data don't
	  keep swapping in and out... it was fine under dosemu on my
	  P/133, but the 5150 slowed down A LOT when it went into the
	  indirect block as it copied 2K every sys_read.
	* I think the real problem is that the fmemcpy code makes about
	  4,000 call/ret sequences to copy those two buffers. With each
	  call/ret sequence eating up at least 36 cycles, that's a good
	  120,000 cycles we're wasting.
	* In addition, I made the first part of the inode structure match
	  that of the minix inode, shaving off some more memory. Note that
	  group comparisons *might* be borken now because of bcc bugs,
	  although I just thought of that (I'll fix that in 0.0.50 too :)
	* This kinda makes it a bit more minix-fs specific, but saves
	  200-300 bytes, and I think we'll need each and every one of them
	  to make all of this work.
	* Also for 0.0.50 (maybe) are more efficent memcpy_tofs-type
	  routines. Since I have a 5150 up now, it might be a good idea to
	  tighten the code a bit so that it'll be tolerable when we
	  actually run programs on it. CGA snow-checking may become a
	  #define RSN too, since it annoys me :)
	* I forgot to mention that strace needed to be enabled in
	  autoconf.h, so if you're going 'where's the strace', look there
	  and make sure it gets #defined.

VERSION pre-0.0.49 NOTES
------------------------

	* The system call # ordering has changed, so you have to copy
	  syscall.dat (in this directory) to
	  (*)linux-86/libc/syscall/syscall.dat and rebuild and reinstall
	  the library and elksemu. Most of the simple programs which
	  actually work at this point don't use any of the changed system
	  calls (much :), but it's a good idea to update your libc anyway.
	* An in-kernel strace has now been implemented which will allow us
	  to track system call usage better (once libc has been changed :)
	  Right now, it dosen't print parameters for most functions, but
	  it uses a table scheme making that rather easy to fix (once you
	  know the types, and look at strace.h)
	* sys_getuid() and sys_getpid() have now been implemented rather
	  simply, returning their respective uid and pid variables
	  directly from current.

VERSION 0.0.48a NOTES
---------------------

	* A few more bugs fixed. There were two bad bugs in
	  fs/minix/file.c - one of which was caused by comparing an int16
	  to an int32, which is borken in bcc. The other was that buffers
	  were not being brelsed like they should have been, which meant
	  that all the buffers filled up...
	* I also have keyboard handling working, but only with the BIOS
	  console, which is compiled in right now... it's a half-broken
	  implementation though. If someone has any ideas on how to do
	  this better, feel free to put them in code and send them to me
	  (please :) Right now keyboard I/O blocks everything, because I
	  don't think querying keys works right under dosemu, but it
	  should work on most machines...
	* ash does not work yet, but it does start - freezeing after it
	  goes into cmdloop() for some reason. We need smaller tests where
	  we can confirm breakage points easier, and still run them as
	  /sbin/init, which rules out some of the tests in libc-86 as they
	  are 'out of the box'.
	* The test directory is still evolving. Trying to get fork/exec
	  working in code okay...

VERSION 0.0.48 NOTES
--------------------

	* Reading files past 6K is no longer broken! YES! :) Supplied with
	  this is a compressed 1.44MB disk image which contains the
	  program used to copy this, and a suitable 12K file (the Linux
	  1.2.x readme) to display, just to prove I'm not making this up :)
	* Basically, this fixes many bugs in pre-0.0.48 involving the new
	  buffer cache setup and the fs system. There was also a nasty bug
	  in the block device subsystem which involved ended requests not
	  being reset right (limiting the number of requests to 20...)
	  which I fixed. I also replaced minix_getblk with something based
	  on the 0.0.12 bmap stuff (>519K files are not yet supported,
	  since I was too lazy to write the code)i
	* There are probably a few bad bugs left, and a few kludges to fix
	  (e.g. the one I just put into the console driver which treats
	  '\n' like '\n\r'...) , and a keyboard driver to add before we
	  can even consider bumping this up to 0.1.0 though... but this
	  version is a step in that direction.

VERSION pre-0.0.48 NOTES
------------------------

	* This version features a new two-tier buffer cache design, which
	  I was able to graft onto the existing one. Basically, what I've
	  done is set up a 64K segment in which we can stick in 64 buffers
	  (the L2 cache). When we need to access their data, we map them
	  into the L1 cache for a while. After it's done, unmap_buffer()
	  is called, allowing the buffer to be unmapped. The actual
	  unmapping is only done in map_buffer so that a buffer can be
	  'remapped' with no performance penalty.
	* Also, buffers are automagically mapped when lock_buffer() is
	  called, making any modifiation to the block devices unnecessary.)
	* This is a 'first cut' at the new design. It somehow worked on
	  the first sucessful compile (even though I forgot to reserve
	  space for the buffers, which implies no swapping to L2 was ever
	  done...) but there are probably bugs in here somewhere...
	* I've just tested it on loading and running 'hello, world!' which
	  works... finally, there are many unmap_buffer calls followed by
	  brelse, which can be optimized by making them one function in
	  some cases.
	* The reason why this is pre-0.0.48 is that I'm not sure if this
	  is the right way to go, and I would like feedback on it. New
	  test programs for /sbin/init would be nice too...

VERSION 0.0.47 NOTES
--------------------

	* The attack on fs bloat continues, with some functions rearranged
	  and all Minix V2 fs support dropped. The code size has been
	  knocked down another 500 bytes from 0.0.46, and it still runs
	  hello world...
	* The number of buffers has been bumped up to 16. Now the kernel's
	  really stuffed with herring :) Seriously, I think it might be a
	  good idea to break the buffers out into their own ds, but that
	  won't be in this version...
	* I also reorganized the comment structure for exec.c into the new
	  one, although I didn't do anything else yet.

VERSION 0.0.46 NOTES
--------------------

	* The root disk is now set to the second floppy drive. Not too
	  much has changed, except for the setup and disk driver code's
	  floppy detection. The buffer cache has been modified to bring
	  down the total code size by 600 bytes compared to pre-0.0.45a by
	  changing the way the flags are handled. This is lightly tested,
	  but it can still start /sbin/init, and it still has most of the
	  same bugs anyway :)
	* There were three different pre-0.0.45 releases - the final one
	  is 0.0.46 to avoid confusion - Chad.
	* If your floppy drive is other than 3.5" 1.44MB, you will have to
	  change the constants in drivers/block/doshd.c (search for
	  "hardcode").
