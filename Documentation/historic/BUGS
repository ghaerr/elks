                                 ELKS BUGS

   This is a list of reported bugs with ELKS, together with the current
   status thereof.

   As and when you discover new bugs, please report them to the [1]ELKS
   Bugzilla System on the [2]ELKS website. This file will be updated from
   there.

    1. Bugs reported prior to June 2001 that may or may not still exist.

       The ELKS source tree contained details of the following bugs when
       the bug reporting system was moved over to HTML format in June
       2001:

        This is a list of things I have noticed go wrong. Please submit
        additions to this file if you find any kernel related bugs.

         1. Sometimes unmounting a non-root filesystem returns EBUSY when
            nothing is using, and nothing seems to rectify it.

            On 26th March 2001, [6]Thomas McWilliam reported that his
            bugfix for this bug had finally been committed to the ELKS
            development tree.

         2. Sometimes for no aparent reason the umount command gives a
            STACK collided with BSS error without unmounting the
            filesystem.

         3. Deleting data from the filesystem results almost always with
            a "Deleting block not in data zone" type error message, and
            sometimes crashes.

            This seems to be due to the following line in V1_trunc_direct

        -               p = i + inode->u.minix_i.u.i1_data;
        +               p = inode->i_zone[i];

            The botton version being the ELKS version, the top one is the
            Linux version. The two don't seem to bear any relation to
            each other. This has now nearly been fixed by chenging the
            above line to

                        p = &inode->i_zone[i];

            But blocks are still not freed when the fs is checked later,
            and neither is the inode! Looking through truncate.c, and
            minix_free_block, there is heavy use of longs which are just
            not necessary.

            Fixed excessive use of longs, and got fs to the stage where
            some blocks are freed, and deleting large files no longer
            results in a system crash.

         4. Adding register variables to schedule causes the chq wait
            queue to get corrupted.

            See comments at the top of schedule() in kernel/sched.c. I
            occasionly get the same wait_queue corruption message when
            heavily testing the multitasking.

         5. Shell sometimes reports "No such file or directory" when it
            means "Out of memory".

         6. Long command lines cause programs to crash.

            When copying files from the /bin directory of a floppy onto
            the harddisk when installing, the cp process often crashes
            before it has finished and frequently displays unexpected
            behavoir. This could be because there is a problem dealing
            with command lines of more than a couple of hundred bytes, or
            it could be a problem that comes up after copying lots of
            data between files. The bug occurs irespective of whether the
            commandline was typed in by hand, or automacally constructed
            using wildcards.

    2. Recent Bugs

       The following bugs have been reported since 1st June 2001:

         1. 24th June 2001: Signals not checked when needed.

            Currently signals are only checked when returning from system
            calls. They should also be checked when returning from a
            context switch.

            Consider an ELKS program containing this infinite loop:

	        for (;;) {
	                i++;
	        }

            There is no way that this program can be interrupted. Hitting
            Control-C will not work. No system calls are made, so the
            signal is never received. The program will run forever.

            What *should* happen is that the kernel *also* checks for
            signals on return from a context switch, then eventually the
            signal will be received.
