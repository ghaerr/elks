Notes on kernel Makefiles:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you add any new directories to the ELKS tree, you can link them into the
standard versions of the standard make commands for ELKS by including the
following lines at the top of the Makefile you create in that directory:

	BASEDIR		= {path to the base directory for this tree}

	USEBCC	 	= Y

	CLEANDEP	= 

	CLEANME 	= 

	DEPEND		= 

	DISTFILES	= 

	include $(BASEDIR)/Makefile-rules

The values on these lines MUST match the following descriptions:

	BASEDIR 	The relative path from the directory the Makefile
			is in to the system base directory. This is used
			extensively by the various rules, so MUST be
			accurate.

	USEBCC		Whether to compile using IA16 or HOST GCC. If this is
			set to 'N' it compiles using HOST GCC, otherwise it
			compiles using ia16-elf-gcc.

	CLEANDEP	Any files in the current directory that the
			`make clean` command is dependent on.

	CLEANME 	Any files in the current directory to be removed
			by the `make clean` command that are not in the
			standard list of files matching "*~", "*.bak",
			"*.o", "*.map" or "*.tmp", or named "core". Also
			removed are any files matching "*.s" for which a
			"*.c" or "*.S" file also exists.

	DEPEND		Any files in the current directory that the
			`make dep` command is dependent on.

	DISTFILES	Unused.

No other variables should be defined before including this file.
