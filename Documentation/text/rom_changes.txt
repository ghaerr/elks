Here is a list of Files I have made changes for ROM_CODE
functionality.

elks\MAKEFILE
elks\ARCH\I86\CONFIG.IN
elks\ARCH\I86\BOOT\CRT0.S
elks\ARCH\I86\BOOT\SETUP.S
elks\ARCH\I86\DRIVERS\BLOCK\DOSHD.C
elks\ARCH\I86\KERNEL\BIOS16.C
elks\ARCH\I86\KERNEL\IRQ.C
elks\ARCH\I86\KERNEL\IRQTAB.C
elks\ARCH\I86\KERNEL\PROCESS.C
elks\ARCH\I86\MM\INIT.C
elks\INCLUDE\LINUXMT\CONFIG.H
elks\INCLUDE\LINUXMT\ROMFS_FS.H
elks\INIT\MAIN.C



Overview of changes:

In this files I have put the configuration

  elks\MAKEFILE
  elks\ARCH\I86\CONFIG.IN


The new boot loader sequence for the ROM-Code

  elks\ARCH\I86\BOOT\SETUP.S
     A lot of information are known in compile time. Tests can removed for
     reduce code size. The kernel doesn't get loaded from floppy.

  elks\ARCH\I86\BOOT\CRT0.S
     In ROM-Mode the stack is already placed.


The Interrupt-Interface had some CS-Variables. I've fixed

  elks\ARCH\I86\KERNEL\BIOS16.C
     used CS variable

  elks\ARCH\I86\KERNEL\IRQ.C
     Variable input frequency for timer 0 (Why an embedded 86 should have
     an special oscillator?)
     Not all Interrupts are mask out. (For debuggers using a SIO port)

  elks\ARCH\I86\KERNEL\IRQTAB.C
     used CS variables

  elks\ARCH\I86\KERNEL\PROCESS.C
     used CS variables


Some additional infos and debug defines

  elks\ARCH\I86\MM\INIT.C
     fix comment


  elks\ARCH\I86\DRIVERS\BLOCK\DOSHD.C
     Some disk parameters get by seek. My flash solid disk has some problems
     with this. The new code uses the BIOS function for getting the drives
     parameters (this made problems with really 360k disks in 1.2 M drives).


  elks\INIT\MAIN.C
     To calculate the bogomips is vary slow at 8088! The new code use a
     constant result. (in ROM Systems this should make no problems)


Some changes for configuration and segment placing

  elks\INCLUDE\LINUXMT\CONFIG.H
