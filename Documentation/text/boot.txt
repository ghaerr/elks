The finished Image file consists of the boot sector, setup code, and kernel
concatenated together. Each is rounded up to a multiple of 512 bytes (i.e.
starts on a fresh sector)

	Sector 1:	dummy boot sector and setup data (1 512-byte sector)
	Sector 2..n:	setup	(setup_sects 512-byte sectors in size)
	Sector n+1..m:	kernel	(sys_size paragraphs in size)

Note that sectors are counted from 1 but tracks from 0, just to be
confusing :-)

REAL BOOT SECTOR:

elkscmd/boot/
boot_sect.S	first sector on floppy disk, or first sector of HD boot partition
		loaded by the PC's BIOS at BOOTSEG:0 (0x07C0:0))

		if MINIX FS, boot loads second 512-byte sector from boot disk.
		That second boot sector then loads second inode which is the /linux
		Image (boot,setup,kernel) at DEF_INITSEG (0x0100:0).
		if boot options is configured, up to a single sector of boot
		options is read from /bootopts into DEF_OPTSEG (0x0050:0)
		for later processing by the kernel.

		if FAT FS, reads root directory entries looking for LINUX,
		and loads its image (boot,setup,kernel) at DEF_INITSEG (0x0100:0).

		Boot then jumps to setup.S at DEF_INITSEG+20 (0x120:0), which is
		the start of setup.S code segment, 0x200 (512) bytes after
		the setup.S data segment (which is the dummy boot sector).


DUMMY BOOT SECTOR:

arch/i86/boot/
bootsect.S	first 512 bytes on disk Image; contains preset values
		of INITSEG (setup data segment) variables.

SETUP CODE:

setup.S		Setup gains control from the boot sector at DEF_INITSEG+20 (0x0120:0)
		which is DEF_SETUPSEG, its code segment.

		Setup first copies the kernel image including header and relocation data
		to DEF_SYSSEG (0x1300:0).

		Setup gets some system/hardware params, and stores them in the
		dummy boot block which was loaded at DEF_INITSEG (0x0100:0).

		Setup then copies its code segment (itself) up to high memory.

		Setup then copies its data segment with the various updated
		system parameters (DEF_INITSEG) to REL_INITSEG (normally 0x0070:0).
		This final segment will be used by the kernel to access them (=INITSEG).

		Setup then copies the saved kernel image at DEF_SYSSEG to
		REL_SYSSEG (0x00D0:0 or 0x02D0:0) depending on whether disk track
		caching is used, as DMASEG and track caching are just after INITSEG.
		The kernel text, fartext and data sections are relocated using
		the a.out header entries in this final location.

		Finally, setup jumps to REL_SYSSEG:_start (the kernel entry point).


(Note: .S files are preprocessed to .s before being assembled)

KERNEL:

crt0.s		Kernel startup code, entry point _start.
		puts parameters passed in registers from setup into global
		storage, zeros bss and calls start_kernel
init/main.c	start_kernel, immediately calls kernel_init,
		which starts kernel initialization. If boot options
		is configured, reads boot options from DEF_OPTSEG (0x0050:0).
arch/i86/kernel/
system.c	setup_arch. Allocates kernel data segment, which follows
		the kernel code segment. The kernel local heap is also
		initialized, and the root device global is set from
		the INITSEG data location.

arch/i86/mm/
malloc.c	init memory manager.

fs/
buffer.c	init buffers, may allocate from main memory or extended memory.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The dummy boot sector contains some parameters at the end:

(0x1ef)495,496   Segment for setup.S			(SETUPSEG)
(0x1f1)497      *number of sectors in setup.S		(setup_secs)
(0x1f2)498,499   root_flags				(ROOTFLAGS)
(0x1f4)500,501  *size of kernel in 16-byte chunks	(syssize)
(0x1f6)502,503   swap device				(SWAP_DEV) now elks_flags
(0x1f8)504,505   ramdisk size				(RAMDISK)
(0x1fa)506,507   video mode				(SVGA_MODE)
(0x1fc)508,509  *root device				(root_dev)
(0x1fe)510,511   constant flag 0xAA55

*patched by arch/i86/tools/build when the kernel is being built.
Only 497, 500,501 and 508,509 are used at present.

Setup and INITSEG Variables
---------------------------
INITSEG variables are mostly used to pass information from the boot loader
to setup, and also the kernel. This is unfortunately still a kind of
black-magic area of ELKS.

Setup is ASM code that executes immediately after the boot loader, and
prior to the kernel. It is located in the 2nd 512 bytes of the kernel image
on disk (/linux).

The first 512 bytes of the kernel disk image is a dummy boot sector that
contains preset values for certain setup variable locations. Following that
is the a.out kernel executable header and then the kernel text, fartext,
data and relocation table sections.

When building the kernel image Image, a special tool called build is used to
concatenate the dummy boot loader, the setup code and the kernel executable
together. build also writes the sizes of setup and the kernel into INITSEG,
which at the time is the dummy boot sector.

Setup's data segment is at a fixed location and is called INITSEG, and is
initially the contents of the dummy boot sector. Setup is required to
perform the relocations from the a.out relocation table on the kernel
executable, and also to determine certain hardware configurations easier done
in assembly, which are saved in it's data segment (INITSEG), which is also
known to the kernel, since it's at a fixed segment address.

After relocation, setup passes control to the kernel _start in crt0.S, which
then calls start_kernel. The kernel can still read various INITSEG values
using the setupb/setupw functions.
