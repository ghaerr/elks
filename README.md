# What is this ?

This is a stable fork of ELKS Linux. It is version 0.4 of ELKS with some extra bug fixes and configurations. It is a version that has been tested.

This is a project providing a Linux-like OS for systems based on the Intel
IA16 architecture (16-bit processors: 8086, 8088, 80188, 80186, 80286,
NEC V20, V30 and compatibles).

Such systems are ancient computers (IBM-PC XT / AT and clones), or more
recent SBC / SoC / FPGA that reuse the huge hardware & software legacy
from that popular platform.
