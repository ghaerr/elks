-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Sun Aug 20 21:51:25 UTC 2006	Claudio Matsuoka <claudio@mandriva.com>

	* Allow loading Minix executables with total size larger than
	  64KB, such as ash (70140 bytes). Currently the total size
	  minus 32 bytes of header was limited to 16-bit.

	* Set tty1 back to minor 0. This is different from Linux
	  numbering, but it's necessary to have current ELKS virtual
	  terminals working. This and the executable size change put
	  ELKS back in usable state, allowing logins in the first VT
	  and executing a shell.

Mon Sep 20 23:27:23 CST 2004	Daniele Giacomini <daniele@swlibero.org>

	* Added italian keys support, Miguel Bolanos cleaned the original
	  file code.

Wed Jun  9 17:27:52 BRT 2004	Eduardo Habkost <ehabkost@conectiva.com.br>

	* fix for my last fix: s/rp_cmd/rq_cmd/

Thu Jun 03 21:47:13 CST 2004    Claudio Matsuoka <claudio@conectiva.com>

	* fixed format specifiers to correctly displaysegment sizes as unsigned
	  values, and to display debug messages correctly.

Thu Jun 03 07:48:25 CST 2004	Eduardo Habkost <ehabkost@conectiva.com.br>

	* Fixed wrong struct field name for arch/i86/drivers/block/doshd.c
	* Several fixes ro arch/i86/mm/user.c

Web Jun 02 14:16:57 CST 2004    Claudio Matsuoka <claudio@conectiva.com>

	* Added an extra fix to Eduardos memcpy fix.

Tue Jun 01 21:00:03 CST 2004	Eduardo Habkost ehabkost@conectiva.com.br

	* Fix memcpy_{to,from}fs, adding code to save the contents of SI and DI

Mon May 31 07:39:47 CST 2004	Tommy McCabe <rocketjet314@yahoo.com>

	* Fix wrong assignment (typo?) on printk
	* Fix order of LD parameters on arch/i86/Makefile
	* Use #ifdef rightly on setup.S
	* Fix init to use tty0, not tty1 as system console.

===============================================================================

Sun Jul 13 04:24:44 BST 2003	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* This is ELKS 0.1.3-pre1

Sat Jul 12 12:24:36 BST 2003	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Rewrote kernel/printk.c to allow printk() to correctly print out
	  signed values.
	* Rewrote kernel/printk.c to produce a less verbose panic() dump,
	  and also to increase the number of lines of stack trace to 10.
	* Various spelling corrections to printk() messages.

===============================================================================

Thu Jan 02 16:12:36 EET 2003	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@gmx.net>

        * Better select hash.
	* This is ELKS 0.1.2

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Nov 01 01:52:44 EET 2002	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@gmx.net>

        * Changed the position of ds in the _registers struct.
        * Added support for loading the new ELKS executable format. This is 
          actualy the big header a.out format. The how things work is
          explained in the Documentation/bin_formats.txt file.
        * Optimized sys_execve() not to reload the code segment from disk
          when it is doing shared code segment.
        * Added the mm_resize() function that resizes a memory hole.
        * Implemented a sys_brk() that actualy enlarges the heap of the
          process.
        * Removed FLOAT_HOLES related code from malloc.c
        * Stack overflow check for new the new process memory setup.
        * Added CONFIG_ADVANCED_MM option to select the inclusion of 
          growing holes and relocatable code and data segments code.
        * Removed CONFIG_EXEC_MINIX. We support minix executables by default
        * Rearranged memory manager related config menus
        * Added the CONFIG_EXEC_ELKS to control the inclusion of code to
          support the new executable format.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Oct 27 20:32:59 EET 2002	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@gmx.net>

        * Removed non-entity MSDOS exe file support code
        * Removed the "big header" minix suppord from exec.c
          since we never use it.

Sun Oct 27 20:08:36 EET 2002	Jay Barr

        * Fixed get_pid() in fork.c to correctly wrap the pid
          numbers

Sat Oct 26 20:38:26 EEST 2002	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@gmx.net>
        
        * Removed panic from sys_socket() when unsupported protocol
          is requested.
        * Fixed inet_create() to fail if there is no ktcp running.

Sat Oct 26 12:59:19 EEST 2002	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@gmx.net>

	* Signal check when returing from a task switch, so that
	  processes that don't make system calls can get signals.
	* Fixed scheduler not to task switch to the idle task then
	  there are other processes running. As a result now we have
	  much less task switches.

Fri Oct 25 16:58:14 EEST 2002	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@gmx.net>

	* Removed all the OLD_SCHED code
	* Fixed add_timer() in sched.c to always re-enable interrupts

Wed Oct 23 10:20:10 EEST 2202	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@gmx.net>

	* Applied fix for the assembly checksum routine in ip.c.
	  Bug found and solved by Jay Barr.

===============================================================================

Sat Aug 10 23:40:20 EEST 2002	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@gmx.net>

	* This is ELKS 0.1.1

Fri Aug  9 19:51:39 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Reformatted Documentation/Configure.help to hopefully ensure
	  that all help text fits within the correct margins.
	* Also converted a few comments from Germanish spellings to
	  standard British English spellings in the process.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Jul 30 01:30:23 EEST 2002	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@gmx.net>

	* Added optimized assembly version of the checksum functions
	  in TCP/IP stack. Saved 608 bytes and checksumming is around
	  five times faster.

Sun Jul 28 18:32:52 EEST 2002	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@gmx.net>

	* Added TCP/IP header compression to SLIP (CSLIP)

Tue Jul 16 22:43:37 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Committed new header file with boot flag details that was omitted
	  by accident in the previous commit. Sorry.

Tue Jul 16 12:00:00 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Converted various '#ifdef DEBUG / printk() / #endif' blocks
	  into debug() blocks, simplifying code layout. Also mapped some
	  "#if 0 / printk() / #endif" blocks to debug() blocks.
	* Corrected calculation of hard drive size.
	* Finished removing the "Roor location" menu by removing all of
	  the relevant configuration variables from the help system.
	* Rationalised configuration variables. The compiler will now set
	  the root flags to indicate that the root partition is mounted
	  read-only by default, the same as Linux does. In addition, some
	  configuration variables that were simply aliases of others have
	  been replaced by the variables they are aliases of. All of the
	  remaining configuration variables actually occur within the
	  configuration system, and all except three SiBO configuration
	  variables also occur within the configuration help system.
	* Standardised syntax of return statements throughout source.
	* Updated script to list configuration variables and map how many
	  of each typo of files each variable occurs with.
	* Verified that current codebase both compiles and boots on my
	  286 based laptop.

Sat Jul 13 19:56:01 EEST 2002	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@gmx.net>

	* Added support for post-compilation change of the root device.
	  The device is now set with the "rdev" command.
	* Removed the "Root location" menu in the configuration as it's
	  not needed any more.

Sat Jul 13 06:51:45 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Inverted configuration options to be more logical.

	  CONFIG_HW_NO_FLOPPY_DRIVE	=> CONFIG_HW_FLOPPY_DRIVE
	  CONFIG_HW_NO_FPU		=> CONFIG_HW_FPU
	  CONFIG_HW_NO_HARD_DRIVE	=> CONFIG_HW_HARD_DRIVE
	  CONFIG_HW_NO_KEYBOARD_BIOS	=> CONFIG_HW_KEYBOARD_BIOS
	  CONFIG_HW_NO_PS2_MOUSE	=> CONFIG_HW_PS2_MOUSE
	  CONFIG_HW_NO_SEEK_FOR_FLOPPY	=> CONFIG_HW_USE_INT13_FOR_DISKPARMS
	  CONFIG_HW_NO_VGA		=> CONFIG_HW_VGA

	* Verified that current codebase both compiles and boots on my
	  286 based laptop.

===============================================================================

Fri Jul 12 19:53:43 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* This is ELKS 0.1.1-pre3

	* Verified that Paul's patch fixes the problem that prevented
	  ktcp working.
	* Verified that current codebase both compiles and boots on my
	  286 based laptop.

Fri Jul 12 19:32:16 EEST 2002	Paul Nasrat <pauln@truemesh.com>

	* Moved the definition of _rs_ops outside of a block excluded
	  by "#ifdef CONFIG_CONSOLE_SERIAL" command.

	* KTCP NOW WORKS !!!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Jun 26 04:11:35 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Clarified error messages in fs/minix/bitmap.c as some were
	  rather too cryptic.
	* Clarified size reports in arch/i86/tools/build.c to remove
	  unnecessary 'd' suffix to some numbers.
	* Verified that current codebase both compiles and boots on my
	  286 based laptop, with the exception that ktcp still fails.

		*** NOTE - KTCP DOES NOT CURRENTLY WORK ***

Tue Jun 25 15:52:23 EST 2002	Manuel Novoa III <mjn3@codepoet.org>

	* Optimised code in elks/fs/minix/bitmap.c to reduce size.

		*** NOTE - KTCP DOES NOT CURRENTLY WORK ***

Mon Jun 24 07:22:08 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Rewrote scripts/vars command so it actually works.
	* Changed elks/Makefile and elks/Makefile-rules to use CFG_SHELL
	  instead of CONFIG_SHELL to prevent false hits by scripts/vars.
	* Changed scripts/Configure and scripts/Menuconfig to use
	  CFG_H and CFG_IN rather than CONFIG_H and CONFIG_IN as local
	  variables to prevent false hits by scripts/vars.
	* Rationalise ELKS configuration options. Specifically, label
	  all currently unimplemented options as being unimplemented.
	* Create a full set of configuration options to describe the
	  possible memory configurations.
	* Added help texts for several currently undescribed options.
	* Listed configuration options that are the second or later
	  options in choice statements (and thus do not need to have
	  associated help texts) at the end of the help file.

		*** NOTE - KTCP DOES NOT CURRENTLY WORK ***

Sun Jun 23 09:25:38 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Added discrete configuration options to describe system
	  memory state.
	* Rationalised existing memory configuration variable names:

	CONFIG_MEM_EXTENDED_MEMORY		CONFIG_XMS_IRQ15
	CONFIG_MEM_EXTENDED_MEMORY_SIZE 	CONFIG_XMS_SIZE

	* Updated various [Cc]onfig.in files to state the correct
	  default values for all options. In theory, defconfig is
	  no longer needed, but I haven't removed it yet.

		*** NOTE - KTCP DOES NOT CURRENTLY WORK ***

Sat Jun 22 09:53:24 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Tweaked arch/i86/drivers/block/doshd.c to correctly display
	  the size of the various hard drives found.
	* Determined that the problem that stops ktcp in its tracks is
	  a panic caused by the stty command that precedes the ktcp
	  command in the rc.sysinit file. Reported this to HarKal.
	* Verified that current codebase both compiles and boots on my
	  286 based laptop, with the exception that ktcp still fails.

		*** NOTE - KTCP DOES NOT CURRENTLY WORK ***

Fri Jun 21 00:27:05 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Updated routine to find source of functions to produce a
	  more user-friendly output format.
	* Removed redundant line from kernel/Makefile as it is appended
	  to the said file by the `make dep` step anyway.

		*** NOTE - KTCP DOES NOT CURRENTLY WORK ***

Tue Jun 18 22:01:16 EST 2002	Manuel Novoa III <mjn3@codepoet.org>

	* Further optimised ELKS source reducing the compiled codesize
	  for the standard `make defconfig` configuration down to a size
	  of 58,784 bytes code, 7,596 bytes data and 51,268 bytes BSS.

		*** NOTE - KTCP DOES NOT CURRENTLY WORK ***

Tue Jun 18 13:12:30 EST 2002	Manuel Novoa III <mjn3@codepoet.org>

	* Found and reverted bug introduced by Riley when splinting the
	  ELKS kernel. This does NOT fix the KTCP problem.
	* Optimised ELKS source, reducing the compiled codesize for the
	  standard `make defconfig` configuration from its previous size
	  of 61,488 bytes code, 7,940 bytes data and 51,276 bytes BSS
	  to 59,568 bytes code, 7,664 bytes data and 51,268 bytes BSS.

		*** NOTE - KTCP DOES NOT CURRENTLY WORK ***

Thu Jun  6 22:17:00 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Redid fix to deal with over-long kernel version names, and
	  made sure there is plenty of room for future expansion in
	  all of the fields in that structure.
	* Verified that current codebase both compiles and boots on my
	  286 based laptop, with the exception that ktcp still fails.

		*** NOTE - KTCP DOES NOT CURRENTLY WORK ***

Tue Jun  4 21:10:13 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Updated Documentation/function.lst to reflect the current
	  definitions of the various functions.

Tue Jun  4 19:43:50 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Added debugging to arch/i856/drivers/char/tcpdev.c to try
	  to locate the KTCP panic problem. Didn't help, but left the
	  debugging in ready for future use if needed.
	* Verified that current codebase both compiles and boots on my
	  286 based laptop, with the exception that ktcp still fails.

		*** NOTE - KTCP DOES NOT CURRENTLY WORK ***

Tue Jun  4 17:45:06 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Verified that all source files that make up the actual kernel
	  source tree are clean to `splint -weak` with the exception of
	  the following, which still have some issues to deal with:

		arch/i86/drivers/char/serial.c
		arch/i86/mm/init.c
		kernel/printk.c
		net/ipv4/af_inet.c

	  The issue with kernel/printk.c is concerned with telling the
	  splint checker that printk() and panic() have a variable
	  number of parameters. The issues with the other three source
	  files are concerned with type mismatches that are not simple
	  to solve.

	* Verified that current codebase both compiles and boots on my
	  286 based laptop, with the exception that ktcp still fails.

		*** NOTE - KTCP DOES NOT CURRENTLY WORK ***

===============================================================================

Mon Jun  3 23:03:46 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* This is ELKS 0.1.1-pre2

	* Completed ANSI'fication of many more source files.
	* Verified that current codebase both compiles and boots on my
	  286 based laptop. However, one of the ANSI'fication changes
	  obviously broke ktcp as that command now panics the kernel.

		*** NOTE - KTCP DOES NOT CURRENTLY WORK ***

Mon Jun  3 13:07:28 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Verified that all C source files including #asm...#endasm
	  sections have those sections excluded for SPLINT purposes
	  with #ifndef S_SPLINT_S...#endif conditionals.
	* Added new command `make fixme` to locate all FIXME comments
	  in the ELKS source tree.

Mon Jun  3 10:59:54 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Killed dependencies accidentally committed in previous tweak.
	* Updated TODO list to reflect the fact that 0.1.0 has been
	  released.

Mon Jun  3 00:43:09 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Oops - Committed tweaks from previous patch that somehow
	  got omitted then.
	* Verified that arch/i86/kernel/*.[ch] is clean as far as the
	  `make splint` command is concerned.
	* Verified that current codebase both compiles and boots on my
	  286 based laptop. Noted that since I started ANSI'fying the
	  ELKS kernel source, the compiled kernel has shrunk by over
	  3k in size.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri May 31 23:28:44 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Made selection of root device n include/linuxmt/config.h
	  simpler and ensured nodes are synchronised with majors in
	  include/linuxmt/major.h rather than having the numbers
	  duplicated in these two files.

Thu May 30 23:45:40 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Added new header arch/asm.h with definitions specific to the
	  use of the SPLINT tool with sections of C code containing
	  the asm() function.
	* Added a document (still being written) on the Minix file
	  system and how it works.

Thu May 30 16:00:37 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Standardised on clr_irq() and set_irq() macros throughout
	  the source tree. clri() would have been acceptable, but
	  seti() is the Search for Extra-Terrestial Intelligence, so
	  is misleading in this context. The current mixture of using
	  both cli() and i_cli() for one, and both sti() and i_sti()
	  for the other was confusing.

Thu May 30 10:57:30 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Completed ANSI'fication of elks/fs subtree.
	* Verified that current codebase both compiles and boots on my
	  286 based laptop.

===============================================================================

Thu May 30 07:22:17 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* This is ELKS 0.1.1-pre1

	* Reverted to elks/fs/minix subdirectory from 0.1.0 kernel release.
	* Re-ANSI'fied elks/fs/minix subdirectory.
	* ANSI'fied elks/net subdirectory.
	* Verified that current codebase both compiles and boots on my
	  286 based laptop - AT LAST !!!

Wed May 29 23:27:51 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Modified {get,put}_fs_{byte,word,long} to use void * pointers.
	* Updated debug() messages.

Tue May 28 18:30:02 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Added list of functions and their prototypes to the ELKS
	  kernel documentation.
	* Added script to simplify updating of the above item.

Sun May 26 23:58:26 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Reverted thinko in earlier patch.

Sun May 26 10:25:01 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Fixed thinko in wrt_disk.img simplification. It now compiles.
	* Converted open_file in file.s to take filename as parameter.

Sat May 25 21:30:35 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Simplified configuration of SiBO wrt_disk.img utility. The two
	  configuration parameters are now in a separate tools.h header
	  file, and both wrt_disk.c and file.s make use of the values in
	  this header file to achieve the required task.
	* Made wrt_disk.img use an unsigned long int for the address var
	  rather than the two separate unsigned short ints that were in
	  use previously.

Wed May 15 16:00:08 EEST 2002	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@gmx.net>

	* Invert the "Is this system call valid" condition in strace.c
	  so it actually works.
	* Added parameters to strace for sys_signal().
	* Fixed the BSS zeroing in exec.c. This caused a lot of serious
	  problems to programs that assumed a zeroed BSS. "ash" was one
	  of them.

Mon May 13 22:47:47 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Standardised macros for debugging printk's - the function names
	  are now debug() for just a string, and debug[1-9]() where there
	  are parameters to be decoded. The ONLY exception is the memory
	  handlers which use debugmem() and debugmem[1-9] respectively.
	  All are skipped if DEBUG is not defined, and the memory macros
	  are also skipped if DEBUGMM is not defined.
	* Verified that current codebase both compiles and boots on my
	  286 based laptop.

Sun May 12 08:32:51 PDT 2002	Ken Martwick <kenm@efn.org>

	* Reverted removal of '#include <sys/sysmacros.h>' header line
	  from arch/i86/tools/build.c that stopped it from compiling
	  on Slackware systems.

Sun May  5 23:28:40 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Removed unused INODE_VERSION macros from include header files
	  as they conflicted with each other.

Sun May  5 23:11:33 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Verified that fs/elksfs/*.c is clean as far as `splint -weak`
	  is concerned. This also eliminated a fair chunk of redundant
	  code in the form of static functions that are only called if
	  BLOAT_FS is defined. However, as this section is not included
	  in the default configuration, this has probably not reduced
	  the code size, although this stands a better chance of actually
	  compiling after this cleanup.
	* Verified that current codebase both compiles and boots on
	  my 286 based laptop.

Sun May  5 20:41:02 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Verified that fs/minix/*.c is clean as far as `splint -weak`
	  is concerned. This also eliminated a fair chunk of redundant
	  code in the form of static functions that are only called if
	  BLOAT_FS is defined.
	* Verified that current codebase both compiles and boots on my
	  286 based laptop.

Sun May  5 17:22:53 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Verified that fs/romfs/inode.c is now clean as far as
	  `splint -weak` is concerned, fixing several bugs in the
	  process, and also eliminating a fair chunk of redundant
	  code (three static functions that were only called if
	  BLOAT_FS was defined, but which were compiled in anyway).
	* Verified that current codebase both compiles and boots on
	  my 286 based laptop.

Sun May  5 10:59:11 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* After much hassle and several false starts, reverted changes
	  I'd made as part of the ANSI'fication procedure. Sorry all.
	* Verified that current codebase both compiles and boots on my
	  286 based laptop.

Wed May  1 23:25:40 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Clarified structures in various include/*/*.h header files.
	* Dealt with FIXME comment in include/linuxmt/msdos.h file.
	* Verified that all include/*/*.h header files are now clean
	  as far as `splint -strict` is concerned.
	* Verified that current codebase both compiles and boots on my
	  286 based laptop.

===============================================================================

Tue Apr 30 22:17:52 EEST 2002 Harry Kalogirou <harkal@gmx.net>

	* This is ELKS 0.1.0, the first beta of ELKS!

Mon Apr 29 22:15:30 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Following advice from Alan Cox and Christoph Plattner,
	  corrected sys_open() entries in init/main.c and verified
	  that the said file is now clean as far as `splint -weak`
	  is concerned.

Mon Apr 29 15:18:52 EEST 2002	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@gmx.net>

	* Removed the "raw keyboard mode" from the configuration,
	  since it does nothing.
	* "meta device drivers", "direct floppy", "direct HDD" and
	  "286 support" are now available only in experimental.
	* "old XT HDD support" available only in unimplemented.
	* Updated the English FAQ.

Mon Apr 29 00:49:41 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Verified that all fs/*.c files other than fs/super.c are clean
	  as far as `splint -weak` is concerned. This does NOT include
	  those files in subdirectories of that directory.
	* Verified that current codebase both compiles and boots on my
	  286 based laptop.

Sun Apr 28 22:55:56 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Enabled init_timer() and add_timer() routines. For some reason,
	  they were #if 0'd out of the source code, but references still
	  existed in routines that were not so treated.
	* Detailed location of FIXME comments in `make lint` output.

Sun Apr 28 21:54:19 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Removed redundant kill_proc function, as it is implemented
	  under the name kill_process instead.
	* Verified that all kernel/*.c files other than kernel/printk.c
	  are clean as far as `splint -weak` is concerned.
	* Detected a bug in init/main.c where sys_open is called with
	  only two parameters when three are expected. Inserted FIXME
	  comment summarising the problem as I can't currently fix it.
	* Fixed one bug in serial console - it tried to open /dev/ttys0
	  when the actual device is /dev/ttyS0 instead.
	* Verified that all arch/i86/kernel/*.[ch] files are clean as
	  far as `sprint -weak` is concerned.
	* Verified that current codebase both compiles and boots on my
	  286 based laptop.

Sun Apr 28 14:49:59 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Rephrased comments in arch/i86/kernel/process.c to avoid
	  compiler bug.
	* Corrected definition of loff_t type from __u32 to __s32 as
	  it is regularly used with negative values.
	* Fixed bug in Harry's swap code that prevented the kernel from
	  compiling if swap was disabled.
	* Verified that current codebase both compiles and boots on my
	  286 based laptop.

Sun Apr 28 12:30:32 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Verified that all include/{arch,linuxmt}/*.h files are clean
	  as far as `splint -weak` is concerned.
	* Changed prototypes for functions in arch/i86/mm/user.c such
	  that all size fields use size_t parameters rather than the
	  unholy mix of {signed,unsigned} {short,long} integers that
	  were previously used.

Sat Apr 27 22:54:16 EEST 2002	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@gmx.net>

	* Added swap creation ioctl in mem.c. Swap is activated with
	  the "swapon" utility in elkscmd package, and currently can
	  not be deactivated.

Sat Apr 27 18:31:43 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Modified `make lint` to warn regarding /*@ignore@*/ sections.

Sat Apr 27 15:12:56 EEST 2002	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@gmx.net>

	* Some more corrections to the mm after the ANSI'fication.
	* Bug fix in swap_strategy()

Sat Apr 27 00:49:08 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Tweaked include/linuxmt/string.h such that the definitions
	  therein match those on the GNU man pages for those functions.
	* Tweaked arch/i86/lib/bitops.c to match the revised prototypes
	  used above.
	* Ensured that the ELKS kernel compiles, and also that it boots
	  on my i80286 based laptop computer.

Sat Apr 27 00:16:36 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Labelled virtual memory swapping support as experimental, and
	  made it invisible unless CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL is enabled.

Fri Apr 26 22:25:57 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Applied `make lint` to include/arch directory and cleaned up
	  or tagged as acceptable all bugs listed therein under the
	  -strict setting of splint, with the sole exception that in
	  include/arch/system.h the function load_regs is defined with
	  a signle parameter whose type is never declared.
	* Applied `make lint` to include/linuxmt directory and cleaned
	  up or tagged as acceptable all bugs listed therein under the
	  -strict setting of splint, with the exception of those found
	  in include/linuxmt/{mm,tqueue}.h which have still to be done.

Fri Apr 26 20:01:37 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Applied `make lint` to include/arch directory.
	* Fixed the bugs found in include/arch/io.h which several other
	  header files import.
	* Discovered that isti() is a reserved name, so changed it to
	  i_sti() throughout the ELKS source tree. Also changed icli()
	  to i_cli() throughout the ELKS source tree for consistency.
	* Fixed all bugs found in include/arch/stat.h with -weak set.
	* Fixed most of the bugs found in include/arch/system.h with the
	  only remaining bug being that the type __ptasks appears never
	  to be defined in the source tree. This is the ONLY remaining
	  bug in this directory as far as `make lint` is concerned.
	* Removed duplicate declaration of get_ss() from header file
	  include/arch/segment.h and added prototypes for declarations.
	* Tweaked machine name for uname such that if CONFIG_286PMODE is
	  defined, we report as a 286 rather than an 8086.

Fri Apr 26 15:21:58 EEST 2002	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@gmx.net>

	* Cleanups in fork.c and use of register variables.
	* Fixed tcpdev to be opened only by root.
	* Corrected the sys_knlvsn() system call.
	* Cleanups in sched.c

Fri Apr 26 14:28:42 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Official thanks to HarKal for finding the bug I introduced
	  during my ANSI'fication of the ELKS source tree.

Fri Apr 26 12:35:31 EEST 2002	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@gmx.net>

	* Reverted a change Riley made during the ANSI'fication of
	  the memory manager code that made any allocation of memory
	  imposible.
	* Added typedef of sig_t in signal.h to make the kernel
	  compilable again after Riley's ANSI'fication of signal.c

Thu Apr 25 23:59:40 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* After downloading and installing the splint C code checker
	  (available from http://www.splint.org/ on the Internet), I
	  implemented the `make lint` command in the Makefiles to go
	  through the entire source tree and check all C source files
	  that do not contain #asm ... #endasm sections. This tweaks
	  the Makefile to implement the global `make lint` command.
	* Applied `make lint` to the arch/i86/drivers/char/KeyMaps/
	  directory and confirmed that the header files herein are
	  all clean.
	* Applied `make lint` to the kernel/ directory.
	* Fixed some of the more obvious bugs to kernel/exit.c found.
	* Discovered that the varargs structure used in kernel/printk.c
	  is not accepted by splint.
	* Fixed some of the more obvious bugs to kernel/signal.c found.
	* Fixed some of the more obvious bugs to kernel/time.c found.
	  At the -weak detection level, this file is clean.

Thu Apr 25 19:05:24 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Committed the results of applying `make indent` to the
	  arch/i86/drivers/char directory.

Thu Apr 25 08:38:13 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Created placeholder files for the routines that are currently
	  common to many of the source files in arch/i86/drivers/char/
	  and tweaked arch/i86/drivers/char/Makefile to include these
	  files in the compilation process.

Wed Apr 24 23:19:32 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Added missing parameter to chq_addch calls in two source files.

Wed Apr 24 20:12:29 BST 2002	Paul Nasrat <pauln@truemesh.com>

	* Tweak to Makefile to stop it overwriting the Config.in script
	  that mkcfg creates.
	* Tweak to mkcfg script to correctly create both the Config.in
	  script and the keymaps.h header file as it is supposed to.

Wed Apr 24 18:40:12 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Actually added mkcfg script referred to in previous commit.

Wed Apr 24 16:14:33 EEST 2002	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@gmx.net>

	* Commited a very important chunk I left out with my last
	  commit, conserning map_buffer() function.
	* Correct data segment rellocation after a schedule(), called
	  at the end of an interrupt.

Wed Apr 24 11:25:14 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Standardised prototypes for AddQueue function.
	* Standardised prototypes for AnsiCmd function.
	* Standardised prototypes for ClearRange function.
	* Standardised prototypes for KeyboardInit function.
	* Standardised prototypes for namecompare function.
	* Standardised prototypes for PositionCursor function.
	* Standardised prototypes for ScrollDown function.
	* Standardised prototypes for ScrollUp function.
	* Standardised prototypes for Vt52Cmd function.
	* Standardised prototypes for Vt52CmdEx function.
	* Standardised prototypes for WriteChar function.

Wed Apr 24 00:14:04 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* ANSI'fied function prototypes in the arch/i86/drivers/block subtree.
	* Applied `make indent` rule to the arch/i86/drivers/block subtree.
	* Verified that the kernel compiles with the above changes applied.

Tue Apr 23 17:27:03 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* ANSI'fied function prototypes in the arch/i86/drivers/char subtree.
	* Applied `make indent` rule to the arch/i86/drivers/char subtree.
	* Verified that the kernel compiles with the above changes applied.

Tue Apr 23 16:35:53 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Simplified keyboard keycodes to auto-include all keycode header
	  files currently defined. With this change, the ONLY steps needed
	  to add another keycode table is to drop the relevant header file
	  in the arch/i86/drivers/char/KeyMaps/ directory, with the correct
	  comment line at the top, and the keymap will be included both in
	  the configuration system and in the code itself. Also, if the map
	  is for more than one language and a separate copy of this comment
	  line is provided for each language, then all language options are
	  automatically included, as currently happens with the BE/FR file.
	* Accidentally omitted mkcfg script when committing this. Sorry.
	* Updated TODO document.

Tue Apr 23 01:27:03 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* ANSI'fied function prototypes in the arch/i86/sibo subtree.
	* Applied `make indent` rule to the arch/i86/sibo subtree.
	* ANSI'fied function prototypes in the arch/i86/tools subtree.
	* Applied `make indent` rule to the arch/i86/tools subtree.
	* Verified that the kernel compiles with the above changes applied.

Mon Apr 22 23:11:38 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* ANSI'fied function prototypes in the arch/i86/mm subtree.
	* Applied `make indent` rule to the arch/i86/mm subtree.

	* Applied `make indent` rule to the arch/i86/286pmode subtree.
	* ANSI'fied function prototypes in the arch/i86/boot subtree.
	* Applied `make indent` rule to the arch/i86/boot subtree.
	* Split system call table out of arch/i86/kernel/strace.c into
	  separate header file arch/i86/kernel/strace.h and labelled this
	  not to be reformatted by the `make indent` command.
	* ANSI'fied function prototypes in the arch/i86/kernel subtree.
	* Applied `make indent` rule to the arch/i86/kernel subtree.
	* Verified that the kernel compiles with the above changes applied.

Mon Apr 22 11:50:00 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* ANSI'fied function prototypes in the scripts subtree, with the sole
	  exception being the ksymoops.cc code as that code is written in C++
	  which I am not familiar enough with to touch.
	* Applied `make indent` rule to the scripts subtree. This also omits
	  the ksymoops.cc code for the simple reason that the indent program
	  only understands C and not C++.
	* Verified that the kernel compiles with the above changes applied.

Sun Apr 21 22:54:03 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* ANSI'fied function prototypes in the init subtree.
	* Applied `make indent` rule to the init subtree.
	* ANSI'fied function prototypes in the net subtree.
	* Applied `make indent` rule to the net subtree.
	* Verified that the kernel compiles with the above changes applied.

Sun Apr 21 20:54:00 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Fixed failure of `make indent` when run in the base directory.
	  Many thanks to HarKal for pointing this problem out, as it
	  was not apparent on my system.

Sun Apr 21 12:31:22 EEST 2002	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@gmx.net>

	* Added mm_get_usage() to mm.c
	* Added a new ioctl to /dev/mem responding with memory information.
	* Changed next and prev in schedule() to register. Also removed the
	  warning comment about corrupting the wait queues.
	* Some changes to the swapper code.

Sat Apr 20 16:28:30 EEST 2002	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@gmx.net>

	* Added swap support. Currently the code is only for "developers"
	  since swap devices and sizes are hardcoded. The swapping strategy
	  also needs tweaking.

Fri Apr 19 22:44:45 EEST 2002	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@gmx.net>

	* Fixed ramdisk driver to read/write to buffers anywhere in RAM.

Fri Apr 19 22:24:28 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* ANSI'fied function prototypes in the kernel subtree.
	* Applied `make indent` rule to the kernel subtree.
	* ANSI'fied function prototypes in the lib subtree.
	* Applied `make indent` rule to the lib subtree.
	* Verified that the kernel compiles with the above changes applied.

Fri Apr 19 17:38:04 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* ANSI'fied function prototypes in the fs subtree.
	* Applied `make indent` rule to the fs subtree.
	* ANSI'fied function prototypes in the include subtree.
	* Applied `make indent` rule to the include subtree.
	* Verified that the kernel compiles with above changes applied.

Thu Apr 18 23:15:09 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Added scripts/reindent to reindent all *.c files in current
	  directory that are NOT listed on the command line, using a
	  standard set of indentation parameters.
	* Added `make indent` command to reindent all *.c files using
	  a standard indentation scheme. The scheme chosen is the GNU
	  indentation scheme tweaked to my personal preferences, with
	  any .indent.pro files ignored and all relevant options given
	  on the command line used.
	* Added new NOINDENT makevar to state code files not to be
	  reformatted by `make indent` - usually because they include
	  '#asm' statements, which indent doesn't handle at all well.
	* Resolved ambiguities discovered by a test application of the
	  new `make indent` command detailed above. These ambiguities
	  were primarily caused by the current coding format omitting
	  spaces either side of the assignment operator, and resulted
	  in the sequences '=*', '=-' and '=&' appearing regularly.
	  These sequences can have either of two different meanings,
	  as follows:

		Symbol		Meaning 1	Meaning 2
		~~~~~~		~~~~~~~~~	~~~~~~~~~

		X =* Y		X = (X * Y)	X = (*Y)
		X =- Y		X = (X - Y)	X = (-Y)
		X =& Y		X = (X & Y)	X = (&Y)

	  In each case, the two meanings produce completely different
	  results in most cases, and which option gets selected is
	  compiler-dependent. Since meaning 1 is depretiated nowadays,
	  all current compilers SHOULD select meaning 2, but there is
	  no guarantee that this takes place.

	NOTE: The ELKS source has NOT been reformatted at this point.

Wed Apr 17 14:40:58 EEST 2002 Harry Kalogirou <harkal@gmx.net>

	* Optimization of the serial interrupt code.
	* Saved 135 bytes by using register variables in af_inet.c

Sun Apr 14 12:41:54 BST 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Patch to give temporary file .tmp extension.

Sun Apr 14 12:07:24 BST 2002	Paul Nasrat <pauln@truemesh.com>

	* Applied patch to enable SIBO port to compile.

Tue Apr  2 21:11:14 BST 2002	Richard Wallman <murkygoth@murkygoth.uklinux.net>

	* Applied workaround for apparent ordering requirement to
	  $DIALOG command in Menuconfig script.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Mar 28 23:06:53 GMT 2002	Riley Williams <Riley@Williams.Name>

	* Add options to select root device.

Thu Mar  7 14:47:03 EET 2002	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@gmx.net>

	* Added MSS tcp option transmition.
	* Fixed do_fork() bug, it was leaving dummy tasks on the
	  task table under memory shortage.

===============================================================================

Mon Mar  4 01:04:28 EET 2002	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@gmx.net>

	* This is ELKS 0.1.0-pre4

	* TCP/IP accept bug.
	* Reduced the TIME_WAIT expire from 2mins to 30 secs.
	  This helps keep down the number of active TCP control blocks.
	* Fixed final "write config file" dialog in menuconfig.

Sun Feb 24 14:50:29 GMT 2002	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Made ELKS not rely on the Linux kernel source being present for
	  the error values, by importing the Linux 2.5.5 errno.h files
	  into the ELKS tree. Also standardised the way this header file
	  is included.

Sun Feb 24 12:01:54 GMT 2002	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Fixed #else and #endif to not fox the bcc -ansi option.
	* Reformatted scripts/Configure in a consistent style.
	* Reformatted scripts/Menuconfig in a consistent style.

Wed Feb 20 12:27:08 GMT 2002	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Added syscall to return kernel version string. This can be
	  omitted by using a configuration option, but only enlarges
	  the kernel by 16 bytes if included. The configuration option
	  defaults to NOT including this support. When it is disabled,
	  the kernel prints its version during system boot, but when
	  it is enabled, that no longer happens and the startup script
	  is expected to do this instead if such is required.

	  For those interested in the configuration option, it can be
	  found under "Kernel Hacking" and is easily identifiable.

Tue Feb 19 22:04:46 GMT 2002	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Added support for printk format using %% to print % chars.
	* Allowed master syscall table to include conditional entries.
	  This is a tweak to the arch/i86/kernel/mkentry.sh script.
	* Updated strace's idea of syscall table to match reality.

Thu Feb  7 00:03:17 GMT 2002	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Reformatted doshd.c to standardise indentation. Also corrected
	  spelling and grammar in comments in this file. No other changes.

Tue Feb  5 18:28:49 GMT 2002	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Removed redundant flag in Makefile-rules LDFLAGS assignment.
	* Cleaned up messages in `make dep` and `make nodep` commands.
	* Fixed bug that prevented strace.c from compiling. Somebody had
	  assigned the same values to different options in the primary
	  SWITCH statement in strace.c and this fix consists of ensuring
	  that all of these values are unique.
	* Fixed typo that prevented some of the tools from compiling.

NOTE:	* Found bugs that prevented meta.c from compiling. Produced hack
	  that let this file compile, but this is NOT the proper fix.
	  Will somebody please sort out the lines labelled FIXME therein!

Sun Jan 27 02:37:33 EET 2002	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@gmx.net>

	* Made the code aware that the serial tty devices minor numbers
	  was changed. 

Sat Jan 26 10:08:44 GMT 2002	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Corrected typos in arch/i86/drivers/char/mem.c

Fri Jan 25 14:31:14 GMT 2002	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Fixed two more assembler sources with strange comment markers.

Wed Jan 23 00:56:51 GMT 2002	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Made autoconf.h auto-created in all cases where it is needed.
	  This includes those cases in the elkscmd package.
	* Remove contents of elksfs.h header if elksfs not enabled.

Sun Jan 20 06:45:50 MST 2002	M Warner Losh <imp@village.org>

	* Allow elks to build on systems where gnumake isn't installed
	  as make and bash isn't installed as /bin/bash or /bin/sh !!!

Sun Jan 20 12:15:18 GMT 2002	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Version number display actually committed.
	* Formatting clean-ups in Menuconfig script.
	* Two Makefiles were excluded from `make nodep` due to a typo,
	  so fixed it to include them as well.
	* Updated arch/i86/defconfig to reflect reality.
	* Removed autoconf.h from CVS as it's generated by compiler.

Sun Jan 20 01:09:25 EET 2002	Jacek Lipkowski <sq5bpf@acid.ch.pw.edu.pl>

	* Menuconfig non compilable fix.
	* Better version number display for menuconfig.

Fri Jan 18 23:22:10 GMT 2002	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Updated TODO list from suggestions received.

Mon Jan 14 16:18:21 GMT 2002	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* OOPS: Previous commit accidentally omitted a patch - applied.
	* Complete dependency checking - `make nodep` skipped two of the
	  Makefiles due to a spelling mistake.
	* Arranged for `make test` to produce comparable distributions
	  before and after the compilation run - previously, the after
	  distribution always included the dependencies and the before
	  distribution did not.

Sun Jan 13 22:37:14 GMT 2002	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Move serial ports from device minors 4-7 to 64-67 to allow for
	  more virtual terminals (currently limited by the minors for
	  the serial ports).
	* Made `make clean` actually clean up *.a files.
	* Fixed warning in scripts/lxdialog/dialog.c about invalid syntax
	  of #include line.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Dec 26 17:09:16 GMT 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Brought include/linuxmt/autoconf.h in the repository up to date
	  with respect to what is generated - but is this file meant to
	  be in the repository in the first place?

Wed Dec 12 22:52:34 GMT 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Renamed variables used in Makefile-rules to generalise it for use
	  in non-ELKS systems, as follows:

		ELKSDIR => BASEDIR
		ELKSSTD => USEBCC

Mon Dec 10 18:52:25 GMT 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Updated TODO file at HarKal's request.

Sun Dec  9 10:54:34 GMT 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Documented existence of `make me` and `make test` commands that
	  simplify testing of patches. They were originally included as
	  part of my testing the harmonisation of the compilation tools,
	  and were committed by mistake, but have been left in as they
	  are so useful. Refer to Documentation/Development-notes.txt for
	  notes for new developers.
	* Simplified elks/scripts/lxdialog/Makefile where it locates the
	  curses or ncurses include headers.
	* Confirmed that updating from the CVS archive and immediately
	  doing `make test` completes without any error messages.

Sun Dec  9 00:00:28 GMT 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Simplified `name clean` and `make {no,}dep` displays.

Thu Nov 29 00:44:13 GMT 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Fixed error in comments in Makefile-rules to match what the
	  `make clean` command actually does.
	* Added wish-list for software we'd like to see ported to ELKS to
	  the end of the ELKS TODO list.

===============================================================================

Tue Nov 27 14:18:57 EET 2001	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@gmx.net>

	* Added user timeout to TCP/IP.

Mon Nov 26 15:19:36 EET 2001	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@gmx.net>

	* Fixed back the fixed sys_lseek(). It seems that libc expects
	  the return value to be passed through one of the parameters.

===============================================================================

Fri Nov 24 02:31:18 EET 2001	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@gmx.net>

	* Fixed sys_lseek() to correctly return the resulting offset
	  location.
	* Made inet aware of CONFIG_SOCK_CLIENTONLY.

	* Fixed the "minix header" bug.

Fri Nov 23 02:32:35 EET 2001	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@gmx.net>

	* Fixed do_fork(). It was not freeing the previously allocated code
	  segment when the allocation of the data segment was failing.
	* Fixed zero tcp window issues.

Wed Nov 21 01:37:32 EET 2001	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@gmx.net>

	* Removed unused config variable CONFIG_IBMPC_RAINBOW pending any
	  decision on whether to port to this system.
	* Verified that all standard make commands now work using the
	  standardised ruleset.

Sun Nov 18 18:55:53 GMT 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* All temporary files now have *.tmp format names.
	* Created new `setdir` script to simplify the `make dist` command.
	  This gets rid of a nasty bug.
	* If `make dep` and `make nodep` find that the resulting Makefile
	  is unchanged, they retain it.
	* Moved `make dist` dir to be under the same directory that the ELKS
	  base directory is under rather than under the ELKS base directory
	  itself.
	* Verified that all config variable renames stated in this CHANGELOG
	  document had actually been committed to the CVS archive.

===============================================================================

Sat Nov 17 18:03:45 GMT 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* THIS IS ELKS RELEASE 0.0.90 !!!

Sat Nov 17 18:03:45 GMT 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Fixed bug in `make dist` - it missed an important file out!

Sat Nov 17 12:14:01 GMT 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Tweaked config variables as follows:

		CONFIG_BE_KEYMAP	CONFIG_KEYMAP_BE
		CONFIG_DE_KEYMAP	CONFIG_KEYMAP_DE
		CONFIG_DV_KEYMAP	CONFIG_KEYMAP_DV
		CONFIG_ES_KEYMAP	CONFIG_KEYMAP_ES

	* Fixed bug in `make dist` that stopped it from working.

Fri Nov 16 09:28:55 GMT 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Created testing commands in elks/Makefile:

	    make me	Creates a test copy of the current tree.
			This is NOT the same as `make dist`.

	    make set	Displays a list of all environment variables
			as currently set.

	    make test	Performs `make defconfig` to create a config
			identical to the default configuration, then
			runs through all of the standard non-config
			commands to ensure they all work.

	* Updated TODO document.

===============================================================================

Wed Nov 14 13:26:39 GMT 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* THIS IS ELKS RELEASE 0.0.89 !!!

	* ELKS now compiles with the SAME compilation commands throughout!
	  Rationalisation of the ELKS makefiles is complete as a result.

Tue Nov 13 23:57:42 GMT 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Fixed stupid typos in previous bugfix !!!
	* Stopped `make Image` from doing infinite recursion !!!

Tue Nov 13 23:52:18 GMT 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Fixed bug in elks/Makefile that stopped compiles: I'd missed a
	  dependency :(

Tue Nov 13 17:40:00 GMT 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Renamed config vars as follows:

		CONFIG_ARCH_PC		CONFIG_ARCH_IBMPC

Mon Nov 12 14:05:37 GMT 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Corrected faulty ASM comment markers to remove unnecessary display
	  of assembly comments.

Sun Nov 11 19:50:43 GMT 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Reverted change that moved definition of UTS_RELEASE to command
	  line as this resulted in the command line being too long. This is
	  still a work in progress, not yet 100% complete.

Sun Nov 11 12:35:14 EET 2001	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* Fix in inet_write().
	* Fixed case when a process writes to a closed pipe from the other
	  end of the connection. Now returns EPIPE.
	* Fixes in the tcp state machine concerning LAST_ACK state.
	* More "RFC" behavior of inet_read(). 

Sat Nov 10 18:27:17 EET 2001	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* Made System.map sorted by address.
	* Replaced tabs with spaces on the contributor list at the top of
	  CHANGELOG file. This make's it readable from everyone, whatever
	  tab width someone uses.
	* Better tcp ISN selection.

Sat Nov 10 00:05:18 EET 2001	Harry Kalogirou <harkal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* Removed details of two fixed bugs from BUGS.html file.
	* Regenerated BUGS file from revised BUGS.html file.

Mon Oct 29 18:26:24 GMT 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Brought RELNOTES up to date.

Mon Oct 29 13:12:49 GMT 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Completed contributors table from CHANGELOG entries.
	* Spellchecked CHANGELOG using British English spellings throughout.
	* Updated TODO document to reflect targets for various releases.

Mon Oct 29 11:03:54 GMT 2001	Paul Nasrat <pnasrat@uk.now.com>.

	* Updated elks/BUGS to match elks/BUGS.html
	* Updated elks/INSTALLATION to match elks/INSTALLATION.html

===============================================================================

Tue Oct 23 17:36:10 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* THIS IS ELKS RELEASE 0.0.88

	* Updated include/linuxmt/autoconf.h to match `make defconfig` results.

===============================================================================

Tue Oct 23 01:44:24 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* THIS IS ELKS RELEASE 0.0.88-PRE1.

	* Brought Makefile-rules up to date.
	* Removed includes for compile.h and version.h - sorry!
	* Preliminary version of documentation of Makefile structure added.

Mon Oct 22 14:22:41 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Corrected ELKS_VERSION_CODE calculation - it didn't work when
	  SUBLEVEL was 0, a case I forgot to test :(((
	* Removed requirement for compile.h and version.h as the relevant
	  values are now provided as defaults to all source code during the
	  compilation process.
	* Simplified creation of elks.spec for `make rpm` command (but this
	  command is not yet guaranteed to work).
	* Wrote design for revised Makefile system. Refer to the file
	  elks/Documentation/Makefile-structure.html for details.

Mon Oct 22 10:49:00 EEST 2001	Harry Kalogirou <HarKal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* Fixed bug in net/Makefile spotted by Riley Williams.

Mon Oct 22 02:06:53 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Fixed typos in recent CHANGELOG entries.
	* Thanks are due to Harry Kalogirou for sorting out the bug in the
	  Makefile's that I was unable to track down.

===============================================================================

Fri Oct 19 11:35:00 EEST 2001	Harry Kalogirou <HarKal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* THIS IS ELKS RELEASE 0.0.87.

	* Final changes for the release.

Thu Oct 18 17:32:06 EEST 2001	Harry Kalogirou <HarKal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* Fixed `make dist` as it was stopping with error trying to create
	  the arch/i86 directory twice.
	* Fixed `make dist` to include keymap headers in the distribution.
	* Fixed `make dist` to include net/ipv4 directory in the distribution.

Thu Oct 18 16:53:02 EEST 2001	Harry Kalogirou <HarKal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* Fix in Makefiles. The `make dep` command needs version.h and
	  compile.h to work.
	* Fixed arch/i86/mm/Makefile to make the tree compilable.

Wed Oct 17 11:32:57 CEST 2001	Arnaud Launay <asl@launay.org>

	* Updated my current email address.

===============================================================================

Tue Oct 16 21:59:27 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* THIS IS ELKS RELEASE 0.0.87-PRE1.

	* Reformatted ELKS_VERSION_CODE to reflect the actual use made of the
	  PRE's as being BEFORE the non-PRE version rather than after as was
	  previously assumed. Also allowed up to 255 PRE's between PATCHLEVEL
	  increments.
	* Bumped version to 0.0.87-pre1 in case anything is using the above
	  field. Don't think anything is, but better to be safe than sorry.

Tue Oct  9 16:03:21 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Reformatted CHANGELOG to make it easier to find contributor's
	  current email addresses.
	* Created list of standard Makefile rules where all rules perform
	  exactly as documented.

Sun Oct  7 20:28:37 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Added `make tar` and skeletons for `make rpm` and `make deb` to base
	  Makefile.

Fri Oct  5 01:08:14 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Removed files created in compilation from CVS archive, and thus from
	  ELKS distribution set. These were elks/include/{compile,version}.h
	  which are both created anew as part of the compilation process.

Thu Oct  4 00:00:00 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Removed empty depend.awk and hfiles.sh from elks/scripts directory.
	* Tweaked elks/Makefile-rules to show my idea of how the Makefile
	  system ought to work. The aim is that the rules in here will be both
	  available and used by every Makefile in the tree.
	* Changed tag v0m0m73 to elks-0_0_73 to match other tags.

Wed Oct  3 23:37:43 EEST 2001	Harry Kalogirou <HarKal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* Fixed bug introduced by my commit of 29 Sep 2001 and spotted by
	  Riley Williams earlier today.

Wed Oct  3 18:14:08 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Reverted changes accidentally made to remaining Makefiles. There
	  appears to still be a bug in the reversion, which results in
	  as86 being called with bcc's parameters, but the rest is fixed.
	* Discovered bug in Harry Kalogirou's commit of 29 Sep 2001 and
	  reported it to him for sorting out.

Tue Oct  2 23:22:12 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Added missing "### Dependencies:" tags to several Makefiles but
	  still to revert remaining Makefiles.

===============================================================================

Tue Oct  2 21:29:28 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* THIS IS ELKS RELEASE 0.0.85-PRE3.

	* Reverted changes accidentally made to elks/Makefile previously.
	  Changes to other Makefiles in the tree still have to be reverted.
	* Added `make elks` rule to elks/Makefile - this will also be added to
	  all other Makefiles as I progress through the tree, and will have the
	  result of performing `make all` in the base directory independently
	  of the current location in the tree.
	* Changed method of calculating ELKS_VERSION_CODE and simplified it in
	  the process. The new method allows for 15 PRE's between sublevels,
	  instead of the 7 that previously existed.
	* Bumped version up to 0.0.85-pre3 to provide a marker for the previous
	  change. This is tagged both as V0-0-85-PRE3 and as elks-0_0_85-pre3
	  in CVS, the latter being the standard used for most other releases
	  from CVS as determined by inspection.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sat Sep 29 13:47:47 EEST 2001	Harry Kalogirou <HarKal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* Added locking of sock.avail_data that was previously omitted.
	* Changed Unix and nano sockets to use semaphores. Saved around 120
	  bytes of code.

Wed Sep 26 23:36:17 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Deleted redundant Makefile's from elks/Documentation sub-tree.
	* Added prototype rule to Makefile-rules to allow automatic conversion
	  of *.html to *.txt by Makefiles.

Sun Sep  9 09:56:25 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Accidentally committed Makefile tweaks as part of the Makefile
	  rationalisation that I started on 30 Aug 2001 that broke the
	  compilation of ELKS. This wasn't discovered until 26 Sep 2001.

	  The part of the rationalization that appears to have caused problems
	  is that of ensuring that ld86 was used throughout to generate the
	  *.a files from the collections of *.o files that were created by the
	  earlier rationalisation, rather than using a mixture of ld for some
	  and ld86 for others.

Sat Sep  8 22:33:39 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Prevented header files from being included more than once, as some
	  header files were not properly guarded against this.
	* Simplified current Makefiles by making use of `make -C` option.

Sat Sep  8 19:51:41 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Added `mkMake` script to scripts directory. This new file forms part
	  of the rationalisation of the ELKS Makefile system that I have been
	  undertaking, but does not impact on the current system in any way.
	  It is an important part of the rationalised Makefile system though,
	  so needs to be included.
	* Arranged Makefile such that `make elks` from ANY directory in the
	  ELKS source tree will compile the entire tree.

Thu Aug 30 19:16:22 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Rationalised ELKS Makefiles to use standard rule prototypes, with
	  elks/Makefile-rules containing all of the standard prototypes.

	  Basically, the rationalisation in question resulted in the ugly
	  mixture of using gcc to compile some *.c sources to *.s and bcc to
	  compile other *.c sources to *.s with either bcc or as86 used to
	  compile *.s to *.o (and some using bcc to compile directly to *.o
	  without going through the *.s intermediate stage) being changed to
	  use bcc from *.c to *.s and as86 from *.s to *.o throughout.

Tue Aug 28 11:43:35 BST 2001	Paul Nasrat <pnasrat@uk.now.com>

	* Patched ELKS CVS source to compile for SiBO.

Mon Aug 27 11:59:12 GMT 2001	Harry Kalogirou <HarKal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* Changed tcpdev.c to use semaphores now we have them.
	* Fixed bug in inet_read(). Should sleep again if woken up and has no
	  lock on the buffer.
	* Did some inet code cleanup
	* Some fixes to the TCP behaviour.

Mon Aug 27 08:24:38 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Unfolded prototype rules in Makefiles.

Sun Aug 26 21:22:43 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Rationalised elks/Makefile somewhat, ready for standardising the
	  Makefile rules throughout the ELKS source tree.

Sun Aug 26 10:54:19 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Clarified what is being incremented and decremented in sleepwake.c
	  up() and down() routines.

Sat Aug 25 23:32:20 GMT 2001	Harry Kalogirou <HarKal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* Fixed bug in sleepwake.c . In down() *s-- was actually decreasing the
	  address with funny results!. Changed to --*s.

Fri Aug 24 18:23:54 GMT 2001	Harry Kalogirou <HarKal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* Made /dev/tcpdev return EBUSY if used.

Thu Aug 23 23:43:28 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Fixed printout alignment error in arch/i86/kernel/printreg.c and also
	  offered apologies to Harry Kalogirou for the syntax error fixed below.
	* Reformatted CHANGELOG back to 80 columns.
	* Made `make dist` use the correct directory for pre-versions, and
	  simplified the creation of include/linuxmt/version.h in the process.

Wed Aug 22 23:25:57 GMT 2001	Harry Kalogirou <HarKal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* Fixed syntax error in arch/i86/kernel/printreg.c

Wed Aug 22 21:35:29 GMT 2001	Harry Kalogirou <HarKal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* Added the needed functionality to enable processes to get info and
	  configure the network. Look at the nettools directory in elkscmd.

Tue Aug 21 18:50:53 GMT 2001	Harry Kalogirou <HarKal@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

	* Changed in scripts/Menuconfig and scripts/Configure a "linux"
	  leftover to "linuxmt" that caused configuration header file not
	  to be written.
	  
Tue Aug 21 18:09:08 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Whilst I was validating the printk() format strings, I came across
	  quite a few existing %o and %u format specifiers despite the fact
	  that neither was implemented until I added both types to printk()
	  earlier today.
	* Completed the validation of those files containing not more than
	  nine lines with printk() functions. Discovered several cases of
	  printk() formats without a terminating newline, so added such.
	* Found a panic() using a bad swear word, so changed it...

Tue Aug 21 17:23:40 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Updated strace.h and strace.c so all parameter types are printed
	  correctly, also added additional common parameter types to the list
	  of available parameter types.
	* Fixed a bug where an unknown syscall silently vanished.

Tue Aug 21 14:01:13 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Added %o and %u types to printk() and redefined %d as signed.
	  Appropriate changes to printk calls will need to be made.
	* Reformatted syscall table in strace.c

Tue Aug 21 12:23:14 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Documented VT52 sequences listed in the VT100 User Guide. Others
	  probably exist that are only documented in the VT52 User Guide, but
	  I don't have access to that.

Tue Aug 21 11:33:28 BST 2001	Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.cx>

	* Created separate video directory for standalone video drivers.
	* Created new VT52 directory to move existing kernel VT52 driver into.
	  I plan to get this working in user-mode first, to help me to learn
	  how to do likewise with the ANSI driver.

	* Buffer cache and request queue now have segment data
	* Implemented segment stuff in the bios driver
	* Added the back end code (untested so far) for swapping
	* Replaced the wait queues with a V7 like wakeup mechanism with a bit
	  of auditing we should be ready to page kernel stacks of sleeping
	  processes that will free a fair bit of the data segment at the same
	  time as upping the task limit - still need to get stacks smaller
	  than 1K/task.
	* Made select work using a crude hash and the V7 like wakeups. May
	  need a bigger hash

	  disk or as auxiliary partition to transport new files over net into
	  the elks system. RAM_REDUCE reserves memory for that (at the moment
	  the segments 0x6000 and 0x7000 are used as disk to test this option.
	  This is defined in rd.c)

Thu Oct  8 20:40:30 BST 1998	Alistair Riddoch <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Added very simple signal support.

Mon Oct  5 11:15:30 BST 1998	Alistair Riddoch <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Sep 25 12:37:30 BST 1998	Alistair Riddoch <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	  in fs/ and fs/elksfs/.

Sat Sep 26 01:50:30 CET 1998	Simon Weijgers <mbit@mbit.doa.org>

Sat Sep 26 00:32:30 CET 1998	Simon Weijgers <mbit@mbit.doa.org>
	
	* "Fixed" Documentation/Configure.help so that help text
	  fits in the menuconfig help-window line length.

Fri Sep 25 15:30:45 BST 1998	Alistair Riddoch <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* Fixed some bugs pointed out by Marnix Coppens <maco@telindus.be>
	* Changed code at 147 in arch/i86/mm/user.c in strlen_fromfs
	  which should use es:di to point to a string rather than ds:si.
	* Fixed code in fs/exec.c which uses file.f_op before it has been
	  checked.
	* Replaced code that clears bss in exec() to a call to fmemset() but
	  this did not work. fmemset() may be buggy.
	* Fixed chq_erase() so it zeroes len, not size, and ifdef'd it out.
	* Tweaked getch and addch so they deal with waiting in less code,
	  and modified checks for q->size - 1 into checks for q->size.
	* ifdef'd out chq_delch

Thu Sep 24 23:28:33 CET 1998	Simon Weijgers <mbit@mbit.doa.org>

	* Changed top level Makefile to make it clean up all dependency
	  stuff in all Makefiles. Should make it easier (no rejects) to
	  patch and diff stuff. 

Wed Sep 23 16:10:04 CET 1998	Simon Weijgers <mbit@mbit.doa.org>

	* Changed #include <errno.h> to #include <linuxmt/errno.h> in file
	  arch/i86/drivers/block/rd.c. It doesn't matter for compilation
	  but it should be a kernel include file, right?

Wed Sep 16 20:20:20 CET 1998	Simon Weijgers <mbit@mbit.doa.org>

	* Fixed infinite loop bug in dircon.c ANSI colour code; the
	  infinite loop would occur when faulty ANSI escape sequences
	  were fed to the kernel.
