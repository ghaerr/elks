/* If we are not building the (dummy) boot sector (elks/elks/arch/i86/boot/
   {bootsect.S, netbootsect.S}) at the start of /linux, then define
   constants giving the offsets of various fields within /linux.

   The "dummy" boot sector is no longer built or executed. Instead, the values
   below correspond to offsets in the 512-byte setup.S data segment, known as INITSEG.
   These values are initialized then shared with Linux kernel at startup through the
   same segment. The tools/build utility writes a 512-byte sector of zeros
   prepended to the setup and kernel images, with the elks_magic, setup_sects,
   and syssize fields filled in, which are then either checked by the real
   boot sector (elks_magic) or shared with setup.S for relocating the kernel
   (setup_sects and syssize) at boot.

   The fields in /linux are mainly based on an old version of the Linux/x86
   Boot Protocol (https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/x86/boot.html).
   Fields which are specific to ELKS are indicated below.  */
