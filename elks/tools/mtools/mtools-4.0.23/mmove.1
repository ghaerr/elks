file or subdirectory.

\&\fR\&\f(CWMmove\fR moves or renames an existing MS-DOS file or
subdirectory. Unlike the MS-DOS version of \fR\&\f(CWMOVE\fR, \fR\&\f(CWmmove\fR is
able to move subdirectories.  Files or directories can only be moved
within one file system. Data cannot be moved from MS-DOS to Unix or
vice-versa.  If you omit the drive letter from the target file or
directory, the same letter as for the source is assumed.  If you omit
the drive letter from all parameters, drive a: is assumed by default.

.SH Viewing\ the\ texi\ doc
This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo
documentation. However, this process is only approximative, and some
items, such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this
translation process.  Indeed, these items have no appropriate
representation in the manpage format.  Moreover, not all information has
been translated into the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise you to
use the original texinfo doc.  See the end of this manpage for
instructions how to view the texinfo doc.

The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in
the info version certain examples are difficult to read due to the
quoting conventions used in info.
