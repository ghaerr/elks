.SH Description
.PP
The \fR\&\f(CWmdir\fR command is used to display an MS-DOS directory. Its
syntax is:
.PP
\&\fR\&\f(CWmdir\fR [\fR\&\f(CW-/\fR] [\fR\&\f(CW-f\fR] [\fR\&\f(CW-w\fR] [\fR\&\f(CW-a\fR] [\fR\&\f(CW-b\fR] \fImsdosfile\fR [ \fImsdosfiles\fR\&...] 
.PP
\&\fR\&\f(CWMdir\fR
displays the contents of MS-DOS directories, or the entries for some
MS-DOS files.
.PP
\&\fR\&\f(CWMdir\fR supports the following command line options:
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CW/\fR\ 
Recursive output, just like MS-DOS' \fR\&\f(CW-s\fR option
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWw\fR\ 
Wide output.  With this option, \fR\&\f(CWmdir\fR prints the filenames across
the page without displaying the file size or creation date.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWa\fR\ 
Also list hidden files.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWf\fR\ 
Fast.  Do not try to find out free space.  On larger disks, finding out
the amount of free space takes up some non trivial amount of time, as
the whole FAT must be read in and scanned.  The \fR\&\f(CW-f\fR flag bypasses
this step.  This flag is not needed on FAT32 file systems, which store
the size explicitly.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWb\fR\ 
Concise listing. Lists each directory name or filename, one per line
(including the filename extension). This switch displays no heading
information and no summary. Only a newline separated list of pathnames
is displayed.
.PP
An error occurs if a component of the path is not a directory.

.SH Viewing\ the\ texi\ doc
This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo
documentation. However, this process is only approximative, and some
items, such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this
translation process.  Indeed, these items have no appropriate
representation in the manpage format.  Moreover, not all information has
been translated into the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise you to
use the original texinfo doc.  See the end of this manpage for
instructions how to view the texinfo doc.

The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in
the info version certain examples are difficult to read due to the
quoting conventions used in info.
