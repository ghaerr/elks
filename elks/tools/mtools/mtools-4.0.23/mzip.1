.SH Description
.PP
The \fR\&\f(CWmzip\fR command is used to issue ZIP disk specific commands on
Linux, Solaris or HP-UX. Its syntax is:
.PP
.ft I
.nf
\&\fR\&\f(CWmzip\fR [\fR\&\f(CW-epqrwx\fR]
.fi
.ft R
 
.PP
\&\fR\&\f(CWMzip\fR allows the following
command line options:
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWe\fR\ 
Ejects the disk.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWf\fR\ 
Force eject even if the disk is mounted (must be given in addition to
\&\fR\&\f(CW-e\fR).
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWr\fR\ 
Write protect the disk.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWw\fR\ 
Remove write protection.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWp\fR\ 
Password write protect.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWx\fR\ 
Password protect
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWu\fR\ 
Temporarily unprotect the disk until it is ejected.  The disk becomes
writable, and reverts back to its old state when ejected.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWq\fR\ 
Queries the status
.PP
To remove the password, set it to one of the password-less modes
\&\fR\&\f(CW-r\fR or \fR\&\f(CW-w\fR: mzip will then ask you for the password, and
unlock the disk.  If you have forgotten the password, you can get rid of
it by low-level formatting the disk (using your SCSI adapter's BIOS
setup).
.PP
The ZipTools disk shipped with the drive is also password protected.  On
MS-DOS or on a Mac, this password is automatically removed once the
ZipTools have been installed.  From various articles posted to Usenet, I
learned that the password for the tools disk is
\&\fR\&\f(CWAPlaceForYourStuff\fR\fR.  Mzip knows about this
password, and tries it first, before prompting you for a password.  Thus
\&\fR\&\f(CWmzip -w z:\fR unlocks the tools disk.  The tools disk is
formatted in a special way so as to be usable both in a PC and in a Mac.
On a PC, the Mac file system appears as a hidden file named
\&\fR\&\f(CW\(ifpartishn.mac\(is\fR.  You may erase it to reclaim the 50 Megs of space
taken up by the Mac file system.

.SH Bugs
.PP
This command is a big kludge.  A proper implementation would take a
rework of significant parts of mtools, but unfortunately I don't have
the time for this right now. The main downside of this implementation is
that it is inefficient on some architectures (several successive calls
to mtools, which defeats mtools' caching).

.SH Viewing\ the\ texi\ doc
This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo
documentation. However, this process is only approximative, and some
items, such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this
translation process.  Indeed, these items have no appropriate
representation in the manpage format.  Moreover, not all information has
been translated into the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise you to
use the original texinfo doc.  See the end of this manpage for
instructions how to view the texinfo doc.

The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in
the info version certain examples are difficult to read due to the
quoting conventions used in info.
