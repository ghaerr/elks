.SH Description
.PP
\&\fR\&\f(CWFloppyd_installtest\fR is used to check for the presence of a running
floppyd daemon. This is useful, if you have a small front-end script to
mtools, which decides whether to use floppyd or not.
.PP
\&\fR\&\f(CWfloppyd_installtest\fR [\fR\&\f(CW-f\fR]  Connect-String
.PP
If the \fR\&\f(CW-f\fR option is specified, \fR\&\f(CWfloppyd_installtest\fR does a
full X-Cookie authentication and complains if this does not work.
.PP
The connect-String has the format described in the floppyd-section:
\&\fIhostname\fR\fR\&\f(CW:\fR\fIdisplaynumber\fR[\fR\&\f(CW/\fR\fIbaseport\fR]

.SH Viewing\ the\ texi\ doc
This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo
documentation. However, this process is only approximative, and some
items, such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this
translation process.  Indeed, these items have no appropriate
representation in the manpage format.  Moreover, not all information has
been translated into the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise you to
use the original texinfo doc.  See the end of this manpage for
instructions how to view the texinfo doc.

The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in
the info version certain examples are difficult to read due to the
quoting conventions used in info.
