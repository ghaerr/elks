.SH Description
.PP
The \fR\&\f(CWmcat\fR command is used to copy an entire disk image from or
to the floppy device. It uses the following syntax:
.PP
\&\fR\&\f(CWmcat\fR [\fR\&\f(CW-w\fR] \fIdrive\fR\fR\&\f(CW:\fR
.PP
\&\fR\&\f(CWMcat\fR performs the same task as the Unix \fR\&\f(CWcat\fR command. It
is included into the mtools package, since \fR\&\f(CWcat\fR cannot access
remote floppy devices offered by the mtools floppy daemon.
Now it is possible to create boot floppies remotely.
.PP
The default operation is reading. The output is written to stdout.
.PP
If the \fR\&\f(CW-w\fR option is specified, mcat reads a disk-image from 
stdin and writes it to the given device. 
\&\fBUse this carefully!\fR Because of the low-level nature of this 
command, it will happily destroy any data written before on the
disk without warning!

.SH Viewing\ the\ texi\ doc
This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo
documentation. However, this process is only approximative, and some
items, such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this
translation process.  Indeed, these items have no appropriate
representation in the manpage format.  Moreover, not all information has
been translated into the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise you to
use the original texinfo doc.  See the end of this manpage for
instructions how to view the texinfo doc.

The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in
the info version certain examples are difficult to read due to the
quoting conventions used in info.
