Installation of mtools is now pretty straightforward:

  1. Run ./configure
  2. Run make

 Configuration options:

  * Use ./configure --enable-vold to compile mtools to use Solaris'
vold instead of directly accessing the floppy disk
  * Use ./configure --disable-xdf to disable support for Xdf disks on Linux
  * Use ./configure --enable-new-vold to compile mtools to use the *new* 
vold for Solaris. With this, you no longer need precmd=volcheck, and
users don't need to type "eject" before pushing the button.

Further doc can be found in the manpages, and in the texinfo doc. The
texinfo doc contains the same info as the manpages, but is more up to
date. To generate a printable doc, make dvi. To generate an info file,
make info.
