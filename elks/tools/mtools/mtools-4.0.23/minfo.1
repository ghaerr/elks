.SH Description
.PP
The \fR\&\f(CWminfo\fR command prints the parameters of a MS-DOS file system, such
as number of sectors, heads and cylinders.  It also prints an mformat
command line which can be used to create a similar MS-DOS file system on
another media.  However, this doesn't work with 2m or XDF media, and
with MS-DOS 1.0 file systems

.SH Viewing\ the\ texi\ doc
This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo
documentation. However, this process is only approximative, and some
items, such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this
translation process.  Indeed, these items have no appropriate
representation in the manpage format.  Moreover, not all information has
been translated into the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise you to
use the original texinfo doc.  See the end of this manpage for
instructions how to view the texinfo doc.

The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in
the info version certain examples are difficult to read due to the
quoting conventions used in info.
