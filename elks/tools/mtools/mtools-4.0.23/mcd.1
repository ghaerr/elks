.SH Description
.PP
The \fR\&\f(CWmcd\fR command is used to change the mtools working directory
on the MS-DOS disk. It uses the following syntax:
.PP
 
.nf
.ft 3
.in +0.3i
\&\fR\&\f(CWmcd [\fImsdosdirectory\fR\&\f(CW]
.fi
.in -0.3i
.ft R
.PP
 
\&\fR
.PP
Without arguments, \fR\&\f(CWmcd\fR reports the current device and working
directory.  Otherwise, \fR\&\f(CWmcd\fR changes the current device and current
working directory relative to an MS-DOS file system.
.PP
The environmental variable \fR\&\f(CWMCWD\fR may be used to locate the file
where the device and current working directory information is stored.
The default is \fR\&\f(CW\(if$HOME/.mcwd\(is\fR.  Information in this file is ignored
if the file is more than 6 hours old.
.PP
\&\fR\&\f(CWMcd\fR returns 0 on success or 1 on failure.
.PP
Unlike MS-DOS versions of \fR\&\f(CWCD\fR, \fR\&\f(CWmcd\fR can be used to change to
another device. It may be wise to remove old \fR\&\f(CW\(if.mcwd\(is\fR files at logout.

.SH Viewing\ the\ texi\ doc
This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo
documentation. However, this process is only approximative, and some
items, such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this
translation process.  Indeed, these items have no appropriate
representation in the manpage format.  Moreover, not all information has
been translated into the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise you to
use the original texinfo doc.  See the end of this manpage for
instructions how to view the texinfo doc.

The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in
the info version certain examples are difficult to read due to the
quoting conventions used in info.
