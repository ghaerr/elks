	tables in line.

	Fixed another Atari disk bug: Atari disks sport a bogus
	"number of hidden sectors"
v19951125
	Fixed missing zero-terminator in autorenamed long names
	MTOOLS_SKIP_CHECK now implies MTOOLS_FAT_COMPATIBILITY.
v19951124
	Fixed small quoted-printable-induced typo in the Makefile.
	<rant>
	Folks, please don't use quoted-printable. It sometimes changes
	the CONTENT of your messages. Even the MIME RFC's acknowledge this.
	Case in point: £400 gets transformed into =A3400, which looks
	like 3400 pounds to a person unaware of this MIME "feature".
	</rant>
v19951123
	Mformat now puts a 12 bit FAT on ED to better match Messy DOS'
	behavior.

	Fixed YAHB (yet another hash table bug :) ) . Hope this one's
	the last.
	Centralizing most env-var handling.
	Update of the mtools manpage.
	Xdf is now optional, and only active if MTOOLS_USE_XDF is
	set. Saves a few milliseconds of startup time on non Xdf
	disks.
	Some lawyer-proofing, just in case :)
v19951106
	Fast xdf code (finally!)
	Minor performance enhancements here and there.
	Names which are all lower case now generate a long name entry
	(according to Steve Searle, that's how Win'95 behaves).
v19951029
	Character translation table fixes. Other name fixes.
v19951026
	Put restrictions on long names to better match Win'95.
	(suggested by Steve Searle)

	hash table was filled with deleted entries.
v19951023
	added Atari ST-style serial numbers (they live in the banner)

	Both changes were suggested by D. Hugh Redelmeier (hugh@mimosa.com)
v19950916
	v2.5.3 released (after lots of fixes)
v19950904
	v2.5.2 released
v19950904
	mdir.c: initialized "files" and "blocks" to avoid complaint by GCC
	mattrib.c: initialized "code" to avoid complaint by GCC
v19950904
	Based on comments by Paul Slootman <paul@ahwau.ahold.nl>:
	init.c: fs_init(): initialized disk_size to 0.  The section
		which previously initialized this is ifdef'd out.  Why?
	Makefile, device.c: Passed ETCDIR (e.g. /etc or /etc/default)
		Gee, the Makefile is pretty ugly!  It might be good to start
		thinking about autoconfigure, or at least some cleanup.
	Makefile, mformat.c: use -DSOLARIS2, use srand48()/rand48()
	msdos.h, file.c, mdir.c: prefixed YEAR/MONTH/DAY/HOUR/MINUTE/
		SEC with DOS_ to avoid conflicts with <sys/time.h> on SVR4
	devices.c: use %i instead of %d to allow different bases
	parse.c: Changed comment for get_name()/get_path(); need to
		revisit this after deciding on default case behavior
	devices.c: load_devices(): fixed bad fprintf, line 748
	parse.c, mformat.c, misc.c: replaced expressions like
		  "if (islower(foo)) foo=toupper(foo)" with "foo=toupper(foo)"
		
v19950829
	v2.5.1 released

v19950829
	Based on comments by Martin Kraemer <Martin.Kraemer@mch.sni.de>:

		(Siemens SVR4):
		plain_io.c
		mk_direntry.c
		vfat.h

v19950822 v2.5 released

v19950820 DCN
	Change null-fill for unused remainder of VSE to 0xff fill for
	both upper and lower character (just one null for termination)
	This seems to better match Win95's behavior; Win95 had been
	complaining about bogus characters
	file_name.c: unicode_write()

v19950820 DCN
	Commented out enforcement of VSEs being in order.  Win95 likes
	to put them exactly backwards, so we'd better tolerate getting
	them any way they might come!  Not sure what is lost by losing
	these checks, but it seems to be OK.

	directory.c: dir_read()
