Compilation
-----------

 To compile mtools on Unix, first type ./configure, then make.  To
compile mtools on a Bebox, refer to README.BEBOX.

Doc
---

 The most uptodate doc of this package is the texinfo doc. Type 'make
info' to get online info doc, and 'make dvi ; dvips mtools.dvi' to get
a printed copy.  The info doc has a concept index.  Make use of it.
 You may get an info copy using the following command 'make info'.
This can then be viewed using emacs' info mode, or using a standalone
info viewer.
 Man pages are still present, but contain less information.
 If you do not have the necessary tools to view the texinfo doc, you
may also find it on the World Wide Web at the following locations:
  http://ftp.gnu.org/software/mtools/manual/mtools.html

Compiler
--------

 Mtools should be compiled with an Ansi compiler, preferably gcc
