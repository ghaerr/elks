.SH Description
.PP
The \fR\&\f(CWmren\fR command is used to rename or move an existing MS-DOS
file or subdirectory. Its syntax is:
.PP
.ft I
.nf
\&\fR\&\f(CWmren\fR [\fR\&\f(CW-voOsSrRA\fR] \fIsourcefile\fR \fItargetfile\fR
.fi
.ft R
 
.PP
\&\fR\&\f(CWMren\fR
renames an existing file on an MS-DOS file system.
.PP
In verbose mode, \fR\&\f(CWMren\fR displays the new filename if the name
supplied is invalid.
.PP
If the first syntax is used (only one source file), and if the target
name doesn't contain any slashes or colons, the file (or subdirectory)
is renamed in the same directory, instead of being moved to the current
\&\fR\&\f(CWmcd\fR directory as would be the case with \fR\&\f(CWmmove\fR. Unlike the
MS-DOS version of \fR\&\f(CWREN\fR, \fR\&\f(CWmren\fR can be used to rename
directories.

.SH Viewing\ the\ texi\ doc
This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo
documentation. However, this process is only approximative, and some
items, such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this
translation process.  Indeed, these items have no appropriate
representation in the manpage format.  Moreover, not all information has
been translated into the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise you to
use the original texinfo doc.  See the end of this manpage for
instructions how to view the texinfo doc.

The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in
the info version certain examples are difficult to read due to the
quoting conventions used in info.
