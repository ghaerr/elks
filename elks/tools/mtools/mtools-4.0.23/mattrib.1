.SH Description
.PP
\&\fR\&\f(CWMattrib\fR is used to change MS-DOS file attribute flags. It has the
following syntax:
.PP
\&\fR\&\f(CWmattrib\fR [\fR\&\f(CW-a|+a\fR] [\fR\&\f(CW-h|+h\fR] [\fR\&\f(CW-r|+r\fR]
[\fR\&\f(CW-s|+s\fR] [\fR\&\f(CW-/\fR]  [\fR\&\f(CW-p\fR] [\fR\&\f(CW-X\fR] \fImsdosfile\fR [ \fImsdosfiles\fR \&... ]
.PP
\&\fR\&\f(CWMattrib\fR adds attribute flags to an MS-DOS file (with the
`\fR\&\f(CW+\fR' operator) or remove attribute flags (with the `\fR\&\f(CW-\fR'
operator).
.PP
\&\fR\&\f(CWMattrib\fR supports the following attribute bits:
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWa\fR\ 
Archive bit.  Used by some backup programs to indicate a new file.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWr\fR\ 
Read-only bit.  Used to indicate a read-only file.  Files with this bit
set cannot be erased by \fR\&\f(CWDEL\fR nor modified.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWs\fR\ 
System bit.  Used by MS-DOS to indicate a operating system file.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWh\fR\ 
Hidden bit.  Used to make files hidden from \fR\&\f(CWDIR\fR.
.PP
\&\fR\&\f(CWMattrib\fR supports the following command line flags:
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CW/\fR\ 
Recursive.  Recursively list the attributes of the files in the subdirectories.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWX\fR\ 
Concise. Prints the attributes without any whitespace padding.  If
neither the "/" option is given, nor the \fImsdosfile\fR contains a
wildcard, and there is only one MS-DOS file parameter on the command
line, only the attribute is printed, and not the filename.  This option
is convenient for scripts
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWp\fR\ 
Replay mode.  Outputs a series of mformat commands that will reproduce
the current situation, starting from a situation as left by untarring
the MS-DOS file system.  Commands are only output for attribute settings
that differ from the default (archive bit set for files, unset for
directories).  This option is intended to be used in addition to
tar. The \fR\&\f(CWreadonly\fR attribute is not taken into account, as tar can
set that one itself.

.SH Viewing\ the\ texi\ doc
This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo
documentation. However, this process is only approximative, and some
items, such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this
translation process.  Indeed, these items have no appropriate
representation in the manpage format.  Moreover, not all information has
been translated into the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise you to
use the original texinfo doc.  See the end of this manpage for
instructions how to view the texinfo doc.

The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in
the info version certain examples are difficult to read due to the
quoting conventions used in info.
