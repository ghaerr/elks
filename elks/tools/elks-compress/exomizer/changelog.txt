2018-05-16
Release of 3.0.0 source code and Win32 binaries.
+ Up to almost 50% faster 6502 decruncher (sfx and stand-alone). However the
  bitstream format has changed in an incompatible way. See exo30info.txt for
  more info.

2018-03-08
Release of 2.0.11 source code and Win32 binaries.
+ No change from preview 3
2018-03-06
Release of 2.0.11 preview 3
+ Improved desfx c64 IO banking handling and automatic decrunched area
  detection.
+ sfx: Detected in-file type exported making target auto detection possible for
  some sfx bin and sfx <addr> (not sfx basic or sfx sys).
+ sfx: Applesingle file write now writes the header descriptors in in ascending
  order, suggested by Oliver Schmidt.

2018-02-20
Release of 2.0.11 preview 2
+ Fix compression improvement loop crashing bug exposed by the thread safety
  changes for library compilation, reported by Lasse Öörni.

+ Make sfx 0xa2 fall back to 4 byte Apple II cc65 headers for in-files instead
  of prg-headers.
+ Add sfx bin directive as a shortcut for creating sfx files with as little
  impact on memory outside of the decrunched area as possible. Perfect for
  crunching Apple II binary files.

2017-12-25
Release of 2.0.10 source code and Win32 binaries.
+ Fix broken things in rawdecrs folder since 2.0.9
+ Add PET 4032 as sfx target from the nanoflite github fork.

2017-12-16
Release of 2.0.10 preview 3
+ Fix core dump when using max_passes=1 caused by static var removal.
+ Change zp-usage of the sfx-decr for plus4/c16 to avoid overwriting current
  device number address.

2017-12-09
Release of 2.0.10 preview 2
+ Add used encoding to the crunch_info struct returned by core crunch func.
+ Rework core compression core to not use local static vars to simplify use
  when compiled into a library.
+ rework -C into a generic favor speed flag and make it disable the crunch
  result changes too.
+ Improve crunch result slightly by also consider same length sequences at
  larger offsets too (but by doing this also slowing it down).

20170708
Release of 2.0.10 preview 1
+ Add a brief output mode enabled with -B, suggested by both Daniel Hotorp and
  Bacchus independently.
+ Display progress indication only on ttys and not when output is redirected,
  inspired by input from  Daniel Hotorp.

+ Add new keyword systrim to the sfx command. It behaves like the sys keyword
  but will also remove the sysline from the loaded infile.
+ Exit with an error if the parsing of the sfxdecr.s fails. This might happen
  with user provided assembly given by the options -x -X -s -f, reported by
  Stefan A. Haubenthal.
+ Change -mtune flag to make exomizer build on more platforms "out of the box".

2015-09-21

2015-09-20
Release of 2.0.8 source code, Win32 and DOS binaries.
+ Fix bug reported and analyzed by Adrien Destugues. The ECHO token in asm.y
  collides with the flex ECHO macro. The cause is that Bison 2.3a and newer
  stopped to generate defines for the declared tokens. To resolve this the ECHO
  token has been renamed to ECHO1.
+ Add -E flag to not write the encoding to the outfile.
+ Remove max nr of chunks limit from the chunkpool allocator.
+ Enforce match max_len everwhere, bug reported by Zik / Futurs.

2013-04-14
Release of 2.0.7 source code, Win32 and DOS binaries.
+ Bugfixed commodore sfx targets to automatically disable irq when decrunching
  over system areas. This together with moving the table to zero-page,
  -Di_table_addr=0x2, allows decrunching $0200-<end of mem> without corruption
  for all commodore targets except for the vic20-configs without a 3kB memory
  expansion since they have a memory hole at $0400-$1000.
+ Bugfixed z80 decrunchers from Metalbrain.
+ Bugfixed sfx c16/plus4 target where the default irq could corrupt memory
  while decrunching data that covers $07f6-$0800, reported by Luca/FIRE.
+ Bugfixed sfx c16/plus4 target where the default decrunch effect could corrupt
  memory while decrunching data that covers $0be7, reported by Luca/FIRE.
+ Added feature to sfx-mode that complains if the data it too big to fit in the
  available memory of the selected target, suggested by Luca/FIRE.
+ Added c16 target, -t 4, like -t4 but with smaller memory, suggested by
  Luca/FIRE.

2013-01-27
Release of 2.0.6 source code, Win32 and DOS binaries.
+ New improvements to the z80 decrunchers, again smaller and faster.

2013-01-12
Release of 2.0.5 source code, Win32 and DOS binaries.
+ Add -C and -M <length> flags that trades crunch result for speed. It is now
  possible to really speed up crunching, even for "worst case"-type files.
+ Now skips the DAG traversing of the final pass if the encoding hasn't changed
  since the previous pass.

2012-08-16

  decrunch effect. Bug reported by Csabo/LOD.

  combine a basic start and a non rom config for the sfx command.  Bug reported
  by iAN CooG.

2011-02-06
Release of 2.0.1 source code, Win32 and DOS binaries.
+ Fix bug in log.c that caused the desfx command to loop if the log level was
  lower than debug. Bug report by iAN CooG.
2011-01-22
Release of 2.0 source code, Win32 and DOS binaries.
+ Fix bug in sfx decruncher setup where data was copied unnecessary. Triggered
  by using -Di_load_addr, reported by nbla000
+ Add i_line_number symbol to be able to change the default line number of the
  basic line of the sfx decruncher. Feature suggested by Chicken
+ 6502 emulator core now features memory read/write callbacks
+ Add desfx -e flag to override the automatic entry point detection, feature
  suggestion with patch by iAN CooG/HokutoForce. (Patch reworked somewhat,
  error handling added)
+ Fix desfx handling of files that decrunch to and including 0xffff, Bug report
  with patch by iAN CooG/HokutoForce. (Patch reworked somewhat, end addresses
  are exclusive everywhere else)
+ Fix argument handling of desfx, Bug report + patch by iAN CooG/HokutoForce.

2008-09-08
Release of 2.0beta7 source code, Win32 and DOS binaries.
+ Refactored some functions from exo_main.c and exo_helper.c into a new file,
  exo_util.c so the testprogram could use them too.
+ Fixed a bug in exo_main where the sys/call basic token was mixed up with
  the basic_txt_start. This confused thes sfx sys sub-command.
+ Fixed a bug in krilldecr.s. The handling of literal sequences longer than
  256 bytes was broken.
+ Added a testprogram to test that the decrunchers in the exodecrs folder
  works. This feature uses the 6502 emulation core to run test programs. It
  tests literal sequences longer than 256 bytes and run lengths longer than 256
  bytes for all four decruncher variants, backward, forward, streaming and
  chunk streaming.
+ Added a z80 decruncher contributed by Metalbrain.
+ Added an experimental desfx command that should be able to decrunch sfx
  crunched files. Uses the 6502 emulation core to run the sfx-decrunchers.
+ Added a 6502 emulator core.
+ Fix rare situation when sfxdecr.s failed to assemble.
+ Improve the help text when no sub-command is given.
+ Improve the handling of ROM/RAM-banking and NMIs for the atari target in the
  sfx decruncher.

   Stefano Tognon.

  complex things in the decruncher source.

  Bug reported by iAN CooG/HokutoForce.
+ Add optional offset,len for raw command file reading.

2005-11-14
Release of 2.0beta3 source code, win32 and dos binaries.
+ i_ram_exit bug for the C64 target found by iAN CooG/HokutoForce fixed.
+ Effect shorthands -n for no effect, -x1 for Accumulator based border flash,
  -x2 for X-register based border flash and -x3 for Y-register based border
  flash. -x<fast effect assembler fragment> -X<slow effect assembler fragment>
