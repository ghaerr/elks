Features of the Exobasic 1.0b2 tool:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Renumber the basic lines (standard), -n<n>,<m> (Beta quality)

   The lines are renumbered starting with <n> and increasing with <m> for each
   line.

2) Renumber the basic lines (extreme), -N (Beta quality)

  This will increase the file crunchability. This renumbering will renumber
  many basic lines to 0. Yes, they will run correctly. :)

2) Clobber the line links, -p (Release quality)

  Normally a basic program file consists of a linked list of zero terminated
  basic line strings. The links between the lines are redundant and can be
  recreated. In fact the basic interpreter always recreate the links when
  a basic program is loaded from the READY prompt. This is done to be able to
  easily move basic programs between compatible platforms where the start
  address of basic differs. The links contained in the file are only correct if
  the file is loaded to the address it was saved from.

  This means that we can write any values as the links as long as we recreate
  them before running the program. The routine that recreates the links is at
  $A533 (c64) or $8818 (c16/plus4).

  The values this option actually writes to the links are optimized to increase
  the file crunchability.

3) Add a trampoline -t, (Release quality)

  This feature adds a small machine language routine at the beginning of the
  program. This routine does all the startup preparation work necessary and
  then starts the program. If the "clobber line links" option is selected, the
  added trampoline will recreate them. When a trampoline is added it is very
  easy to crunch the file and then just jmp the trampoline to start it. For a
  c16/plus4 trampoline add a -4 option to the commandline as well.

4) Remove rem statements and unnecessary spaces, -r (Release quality)

  This feature removes rem statements unless they are first on a line and the
  line is a goto/gosub target. If so then only the rem statement is left.
  It also removes unneccessary spaces between basic statements.

5) Regenerate c16/plus4 stack color table, -c (Release quality)
  This feature only works if a c16/plus4 trampoline is created with the -t and
  -4 flags. It will regenerate a system color table located at the hardware
  stack that the Exomisers built-in decruncher overwrites.
