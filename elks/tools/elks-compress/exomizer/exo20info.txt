Exomizer 2.0

FEATURES

o  sfx mode:
   1) Several different decrunch effects.
   2) Complete user control over memory and IRQ configuration.
   3) Can start BASIC programs properly with built in trampoline by using the
      command 'sfx basic' for the Commodore, Apple II and Oric targets.
   3) The decruncher code is assembled on the fly for maximum flexibility by an
      embedded assembler.
   4) Will adapt the decruncher to include only features used by the compressed
      stream to keep the size down.
   5) Supports the c64, c128 and the vic20 (in several configurations).
   6) The Atari 400/800 XL/XE family is supported as sfx target 168.
   7) Can generate relocated sfx targets without BASIC line.
   8) The Apple ][+ (and //e) is supported as sfx target 162.
   9) The Oric 8-bit family is supported as sfx target 1.
  10) The Commodore PET 4032 is supported as sfx target 4032.

o  Reads Atari xex-files and auto detects the RUNAD vector if the sys keyword
   is given to the sfx command.

o  Can load plain files using the <filename>@<address> syntax.

o  Has a literal sequence escape mechanism that detects and handles sequences
   of uncrunchable data properly.

o  The level mode of exomizer crunches each in-file separately and appends
   them to the out-file.

o  raw mode:
   1) Crunches plain files instead of .prg files.
   2) Crunches forward or backwards instead of just backwards.
   3) Also decrunches.
   4) Handles files larger than 64k. The Canterbury and Calgary corpora
      is now possible to crunch.
   5) Comes with two different C-source decrunchers, one thread safe forward
      pull decruncher and one low-level backwards push decruncher, perfect to
      base an assembler port on.

o  desfx mode that features decrunching of sfx crunched files.

o  Contributed decruncher source (only 2.0 compatible so far)

-- A beginning of something like documentation --------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A note about addresses:
An address in this context is a positive 16-bit value [0 - 65536]. It can be
given in decimal, hexadecimal (prefixed with $, & or 0x) or octal (prefixed with
0) notation. Examples: 3, 54, $3456, 0x1111, 06543.

Please be aware that in some command line shells $ and & have special meaning
if used unescaped. If you use $ or & as hexadecimal prefix and see strange
behaviour from exomizer you might be bitten by this. Try 0x instead and see if
things improve.

All addresses that end an interval of any kind, printed by exomizer or given by
the user as an argument, are exclusive. In other words they point to the
address just following the last byte of the memory area the interval covers.

Exomizer has four sub commands: mem, level, sfx and raw. They all compress
data. They share the following option flags:
----------------
-c      This flag enables 1.x compatibility mode. It disables the use of the
        literal sequence escape mechanism. It will make the output files
        compatible with Exomizer v1.x.

-C      This flag increases crunching speed and as a side effect also reduces
        the crunch result. This flag is for the impatient developer.

-e <encoding parameters>|@<encoding file name>
        Uses the given encoding parameters for crunching instead of trying to
        calculate an optimal set. The encoding must be in the following format:
        xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx,xxxx,xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx,xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
        where each x must be a hexadecimal character, 0-9 or A-F.
        The Exomizer prints the encoding parameters used when writing the
        output file in this format in order to allow for easy copy and paste.
        Please note that this option sets the initial encoding parameters and
        not the encoding parameters used in the output file. To set the
        encoding parameters of the output file this option must be used in
        combination with the -p 1 option.
        If the encoding starts with a '@' then the rest will be used as a file
        name to read the encoding from. It can be used to read encoding files
        written by the -E flag described below. Please note that the -P and -T
        flags must be the same for this to work since the format is different
        for different flag combinations.

-E      This flag enables an experimental feature for encoding reuse between
        multiple files. Please note that there is no direct support for
        decrunching these files yet apart from the raw -d command and in the
        6502 decruncher exodecrs/exodecrunch.s (when enabled). It changes the
	behavior of exomizer in the following ways:
        1) It won't include the encoding in the compressed files.
        2) The compressed files will be named as the outfile (-o) with an
           appended number. ".00" for the first file, ".01" for the second and
           so on.
        3) The outfile (-o) will be used to write a file containing only the
           encoding.
        4) If more than one in-file is given they will all be compressed using
           The same encoding which will be optimal for those files in
           combination.
        5) When used with -E, the mem subcommand limits the -l setting to only
           accept the value "none". It will also change the default from "auto"
           to "none".

-m <offset>
        Limits the maximum sequence offset used by the cruncher to <offset>.
        The default limit is an offset of 65535 bytes. A smaller offset
        increases the crunching speed but reduces the crunch result. If a
        circular buffer decruncher is used it is important that the maximum
        offset doesn't exceed the buffer size.

-M <length>
        Limits the maximum sequence length used by the cruncher to <length>.
        The default limit is an length of 65535 bytes. A smaller length
        increases the crunching speed but reduces the crunch result.

-o <out-file>
        Sets out-file name.

-p <passes>
        Limits the maximum number of optimization passes the cruncher uses when
        calculating the encoding parameters. default is 65535. However the
        cruncher will always stop when no further improvement to the crunch
        result is made.

-T <value>
        Bit-field that deactivates bit stream traits. Valid values are 0 - 7.
        0 bit: Sequences with length 1, 0=use (default), 1=deactivate
        1 bit: Sequences with lengths where the low byte is 1, 2 or 3 and the
               high byte is > 0, 0=use (default), 1=deactivate
        2 bit: Literal sequences, same as -c, 0=use (default), 1=deactivate

-P <value>
        Bit-field that disables bit stream protocol modifications. A value of
        0 makes the bit stream compatible with exomizer 2.0. You can prefix the
        value with a + or - to set/clear the bits the value represents. Valid
        values are 0 - 63.
        0 bit: Big endian bit orientation, 1=enable (default), 0=disable
        1 bit: Copy byte when reading > 7 bits, 1=enable (default), 0=disable
        2 bit: Implicit first literal byte, 1=enable (default), 0=disable
        3 bit: Align bit stream to stream start, 0=disable (default), 1=enable
        4 bit: Four offset decoding tables, 0=disable (default), 1=enable

-q      Enables quiet mode which will disable display output.

-V      Enables brief mode which will disable most display output.

-v      Displays Exomizer version, email address for support and the usage
        license.

--      Will make all arguments that follow be treated as non-options, even if
        they begins with a - character.

-?      Displays a help screen that briefly describes the command line syntax
        and the valid options. Also for the sub command if one is given.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Information relevant for the mem, sfx and level sub commands ---------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The mem, level and sfx command all crunches files backwards. The files are
loaded into a 16-bit address space and are also limited in size to that 16-bit
address space. The format of the input files can be prg files, Atari xex
files, Oric tap files, AppleSingle files, BBC Micro Standard Archive Format
file tuples or located plain files (plain files that are given an address to
load to.) Please note that all input file formats is valid for all sfx targets
which can be a bit unexpected.

 Plain raw files are loaded by adding an address to it using the @-character.
It is also possible to specify an optional offset and optional length if only a
part of the file is to be loaded. Like addresses, the offsets and the lengths
can be given in either decimal or hexadecimal notation using either 0x or $
prefixes. The offset can also be negative and will then be applied from the end
of the file instead of from the start.

<file name>@<load address>[,[<offset>][,[<length>]]]

* To load a raw file to 0x3456, append @0x3456 to the file name.
* To load a raw file to 0x0400 and skip the 16 first bytes and read the
  following 37 bytes, append @0x400,16,37 to the file name.
* To load the first 256 bytes of a raw file to 0x0900, append @$900,,256 or
  @$900,0,256 to the file name.

 To load a prg file to the address contained in its prg-header you simply add
the file name to the command line. You can append an optional alternative load
address to the file name to override the load address in the header. And like
for the raw files it is also possible to specify an optional offset to start
from in the file and a length.

<file name>[,[<new load address>][,[<offset>][,[<length>]]]]

Examples:
* To load a prg file to 0x3456, append ,0x3456 to the file name.
* To load a prg file to its default address and skip the 16 first bytes, append
  ,,16 to the file name.
* To load the last 254 bytes of a file to 0x3450, append ,0x3450,-0xfe to the
  file name.

 Relocation does not work for xex or tap files. A relocated xex or tap file
will simply be treated as if it was a relocated prg file.

 When given multiple input files the sfx and mem commands loads all files to
where they are located and then crunch the covered memory area. Any unused
space between files will be zero-filled. Data segments in xex-files are loaded
sequentially in the same way. INITAD segments in xex-files are ignored.

 The level command, on the other hand, loads each input file separately,
crunches it and then appends the crunched data to the output file.

 The auto detection of xex or Oric tap files is not perfect. Prg files that
load at $ffff or $1616 will be wrongly detected as xex or Oric tap. To disable
the auto detection relocate the prg files to the same address they normally
load to.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The mem sub command --------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The mem command generated files that are used for decrunching from memory.
Normally these files are linked into the program images either by machine code
monitors or by assembler directives like incbin.

 The mem command writes its output in prg format. It has the following option:

-l <address>|none
        Sets the load address of the output prg file to <address>. If the
        string none is given the output will be a plain file. Defaults to the
        address that gives the crunched data as much overlap with the
        decrunched data as possible but still allow for in-place decrunching.
        However, the file doesn't need to be decrunched from that address. Any
        address that doesn't cause data being decrunched to overwrite data yet
        to be decrunched will work.
-f      Crunch the file forward instead of backwards that is the default. This
        means that in this mode the read and write pointers move forward in
        memory while decrunching. The exodecrunch.s file supports optional
        forward decrunching but defaults to backwards. Read the comments in the
        file for more details on the available options.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The level sub command ------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The level command writes its output file so that the crunched bytes are
returned in correct order for decrunching in the fly while streaming in the
bytes from secondary storage.

-f      Crunch the file forward instead of backwards that is the default. This
        means that in this mode the write pointer move forward in memory while
        decrunching. The exodecrunch.s does not support forward decrunching.
        For this feature to work You'll have to use Krill's contributed
        decruncher.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The sfx sub command --------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The sfx command generates a runnable stand alone in memory decrunching file.
Its first argument must always be the run address. It may be given as an
address or of the following string sys, systrim, bin and basic.

 If the run address is an actual address then it will be used as the target
address of a jmp instruction executed after the decrunching.

 If the run address is the string sys then the run address will be
auto detected by scanning the area of the basic start for a SYS (or CALL) BASIC
command.

 The keyword systrim behaves just like keyword sys but it also excludes the
memory area that contains the SYS BASIC line from being included in the
crunched file. This is very handy for the unexpanded VIC-20 target which
normally can't decrunch sfx-ed programs residing at the BASIC start since it
has a memory hole that will overlap with the crunched data. By using systrim,
the start of decrunched data will be moved a few bytes and by that also move
the crunched data out of the memory hole.

 If the run address is the string bin then the run address will be detected
from the in-file. If no in-file is given that contains any run address then it
will be set to the start address of the combined memory area of the loaded in-
files. An implicit -Di_load_addr=<A> will be used as well so the load and run
addresses of the generated file will be A too. The generated file will not
contain any basic stub.

 If the run address is the string basic then the computer will run a BASIC
program after decrunch. This is not yet implemented for the Atari target.
The Oric target support BASIC start for the Oric 1 and Atmos computers but not
for the Telestrat.

 The run BASIC mode takes up to three optional addresses. They are in order:
start of BASIC program, end of BASIC program  and highest address used by
BASIC.

$ exomizer sfx basic[,<start>[,<end>[,<high>]]]

 The start of BASIC, <start>, is the address where the BASIC program starts in
memory. For many but not all targets it defaults to $0801.

 The end of BASIC, <end>, is the address where the BASIC variables starts in
memory. It defaults to the address where the BASIC program ends.

 The highest address used by BASIC, <high>, is the address where the BASIC
variables end. Its default value depends on the target.

 The BASIC interpreter will write all variables, strings and arrays between the
<end> address and the <high> address.

 Normally these addresses are auto detected and/or defaulted. However, if non
standard settings are needed they can be changed. Examples of such situations
could be when a BASIC program needs to be run at a non standard address and/or
some graphic needs to be protected from BASIC variables.

 The output of the sfx command is a runnable program file that decrunches
itself in memory when run. If an explicit run address or the string bin is
given then some targets like Atari 8-bit, Oric 1, BBC Micro B and Apple II will
be auto detected based on the format of the in files. For other situations or
if auto detection fails then the target defaults to C64 unless the -t <target>
option is given. This option can also be used to override the target auto
detection if necessary.

The output file format depends on the target used:

 For all Commodore machines the output is a runnable prg-file that starts
with a BASIC line.

 For the Atari target the output is an auto running xex-file.

 For the Apple target the output is an AppleSingle file that almost always
is a PRODOS bin file (file-type 6). But if the loaded file was a AppleSingle
system file then it will be a system file (file-type $ff). However if the run
address is the string basic, then it will be a PRODOS Applesoft basic file.
(file-type $fc)

 For the BBC target the output is a BBC Micro Standard Archive Format file
tuple. (http://archive.retro-kit.co.uk/bbc.nvg.org/std-format.php3.html)

For the Oric family the output is a Oric tap file.

 Please note that the sfx command doesn't support extended memory since it
can't decrunch into banked memory.

 The sfx command has the following options:

-t<target>
        Sets the decruncher target. The possible targets are:
           1: Oric 1, Oric Atmos and Telestrat
          20: Commodore Vic20, unexpanded memory
          23: Commodore Vic20, 3kB memory expansion
          52: Commodore Vic20, 8 - 32kB memory expansion
          55: Commodore Vic20  8 - 32kB + 3kB memory expansion
          16: Commodore c16
           4: Commodore plus4
          64: Commodore c64 (The default target)
         128: Commodore c128
        4032: Commodore PET 4032
        0xa2: Apple ][+ and //e
        0xa8: Atari 400/800 XL/XE
      0xbbcb: BBC Micro B

-X<custom slow effect assembler fragment>
-x[1-3]|<custom fast effect assembler fragment>
        Sets the decrunch effect. If an assembler fragment is given, it must
        not change the X-register, Y-register or modify the carry flag.
        Separate instructions with a space. Please note that including spaces
        in the fragment requires quoting to work. An example of a slow C64
        x-scroll-register effect: -X "txa and #07 ora #$c8 sta $d016"
         Use a value of 1 - 3 to pick a preset effect:
        1:      Accumulator based fast border flash
        2:      X-register based fast border flash
        3:      Y-register based fast border flash
        Default effect is a slow character flash. The 1-3 presets is only
        available for targets that supports changing border color.

-n      No decrunch effect. This option can't be combined with -X or -x

-D<symbol>=<value>
        Defines symbols for the sfx assembler. More advanced features of the
        decruncher is controlled by defining symbols. More on this in the
        decruncher symbol reference section below.

-s<custom decruncher enter assembler fragment>
        Specifies an optional assembler fragment to be executed when the
        decruncher starts decrunching. It must not change the Y-register. This
        assembler fragment is intended for things like clearing the screen,
        changing background and/or border color, changing a c128 to 2MHz mode
        or enable 'Skip internal cycles' and burst mode on a DTV2. The fragment
        syntax is the same as for the -X and -x options.
-f<custom decruncher exit assembler fragment>
        Specifies an optional assembler fragment to be executed when the
        decruncher has finished decrunching. This assembler fragment is
        intended for things like restoring a c128 to 1MHz or disabling 'Skip
        internal cycles' and burst mode on a DTV2. The fragment syntax is the
        same as for the -X and -x options.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The desfx sub command ------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The desfx command decrunches a file generated by the sfx command and writes it
as a prg-file. It auto detects the entry point from the in-file and runs the
embedded decruncher in order to get to the decrunched data. It auto detects the
decrunched area to be compatible with more versions of exomized sfx files but
might fail if the decrunched area is unusual.

 The desfx command has the following options:

-e <address>|load
        Overrides the entry point of the decruncher with <address> or if the
        string load is given, the load address of the input file will be used.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The raw sub command --------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Now let's go back to the command that handles plain files, raw.
The raw command can both crunch and decrunch both forward and backward. It also
handles generic files without any of the above mentioned restrictions. There's
no hard coded limit in file size but it gets increasingly slow with larger
files so there's a practical limit of about 1MB. The output file format of this
command is a plain file.

It is possible to give an optional offset and length for the in-file like this:
<in-file>[,offset[,length]]. Negative offsets and lengths are allowed. They
will wrap around to the end of the file.

To skip the first two bytes but read all the rest of a file do like this:
$ exomizer raw <in-file>,2 -o <out-file>

To skip the first two bytes and the last two bytes of a file do like this:
$ exomizer raw <in-file>,2,-2 -o <out-file>

To read 10 bytes at offset 13 from the end of the file do like this:
$ exomizer raw <in-file>,-13,10 -o <out-file>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The included decruncher source code with examples --------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are two directories with source code in the distribution:

exodecrs/
         This contains the source code of four 6502 assembler decrunchers. One
        backwards decruncher that decrunches data crunched by the mem sub
        command. It also contains a forward decruncher contributed by
        Krill/Plush for data crunched by the mem sub command and the -f option.
        Call these two decrunchers once to decrunch the data to its targeted
        location.
         Also contained in this directory are two streaming forward decrunchers
        for data crunched with the raw sub command. Both use a circular buffer
        and has a get_byte like interface that are called repeatedly to get one
        byte or a block of decrunched data until the end of data is signaled
        by the call returning with the carry flag set. However they are not
        capable of handling the literal sequence escape mechanism so data must
        be cruncher with the -c flag.
         Also included are a Makefile and some example code and data that use
        the four decrunchers. The assembler syntax is ca65, the assembler of
        the cc65 tool chain. This tool chain is needed to build the examples.

rawdecrs/
         This directory contains two decrunches written in C. One backwards
        decruncher with a call once and all data are decrunched interface.
        And one forward streaming decruncher with a get_decrunched_byte
        interface. Also included are example code using the decrunchers and
        a Makefile that can be used for building them. An ANSI-C compiler are
        necessary for this.

All of the included makefiles have only been tested with Gnu make.

-- Reference for the sfx decruncher symbols -----------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The sfx decruncher is tweaked by defining optional symbols to the assembler on
the command line using the -D<symbol>=<value> flag:

The following symbol controls if headers are written to the sfx file:
 i_raw

 If it is set to anything but 0 then no headers will be written to the sfx file
regardless of what the documentation of other optional symbols say.

The following symbol controls the sfx load address:
 i_load_addr

 If it is unset then the sfx file will load to the default BASIC start address
of the target machine. For Atari the default load address is $2000. For the
Oric the default load address is $0500.

 If it is set then the sfx file will load to the given address and it will not
have any BASIC line. (The Atari target never has a BASIC line). The run address
is the same as the load address.

The following symbol controls the sfx BASIC line number:
 i_line_number

If unset it will default to 20. This symbol can't be combined with i_load_addr.

The following symbols control the memory configuration:
 i_ram_enter      (defaults to standard ROM configuration)
 i_ram_during
 i_ram_exit       (defaults to standard ROM configuration)

The i_ram_enter symbol differs from the other two. It isn't used to set the
memory configuration. It tells the exomizer of which memory configuration to
expect when the decruncher is run. This information is used to minimize the
decruncher size.

For the c64 and the c128 target the value of the above symbols will be stored
into $ff00 (c128) or $01 (c64) to set the mem configuration. For the c16/+4
target the possible values are 0=ROM and 1=RAM. For the Atari the value will be
stored in $d301. The Oric target supports 0=ROM and 1=RAM where 1 will enable
decrunching into the top 16kB RAM supplied by the microdisc controller.

Default is $37 for the c64, $00 for the c128, 0 for the c16/+4 and Oric and $ff
for the Atari.

The following symbols control IRQs. (0=disabled,SEI, 1=enabled,CLI)
 i_irq_enter      (defaults to 1)
 i_irq_during
 i_irq_exit

The following symbols control NMIs, this is only implemented for the Atari
target where the value will be stored in $d40e
 i_nmi_enter      (defaults to $40)
 i_nmi_during
 i_nmi_exit

To locate the decrunch table elsewhere than the default tape buffer or $0600
for The Atari target, use the symbol i_table_addr:
 -Di_table_addr=<address>

The Apple ][+ target has an option to disconnect DOS. To do this, set the
i_a2_disable_dos symbol to any value:
 -Di_a2_disable_dos=1

The Apple ][+ target writes files in the AppleSingle format. This option
overrides the PRODOS filetype of the target file to the set value. To force a
file of system type set the i_a2_file_type symbol to the file type value.
See http://www.easy68k.com/paulrsm/6502/PDOS8TRM.HTM#B.4.2.4 for a list of
valid file types:
 -Di_a2_file_type=<file-type>

Decruncher effects are not selected by the use of symbols. They are chosen by
the -x or -X flags or deactivated by -n.

-- Comparison of outfile structure of the level, mem and raw sub commands --
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The crunched files generated by the mem and level sub command are structurally
identical to the files generated by the raw sub command except that they also
contains the decrunch address appended or prepended. For mem there is also the
prg header <load le>. The following table shows how the output of the mem and
level sub commands are related to the output of the raw sub command.

 [exomizer mem -lnone]    == [exomizer raw -b] + <--decr le>
 [exomizer mem -f -lnone] == <decr be++> + [exomizer raw]
 [exomizer mem]           == <load le> + [exomizer raw -b] + <--decr le>
 [exomizer mem -f]        == <load le> + <decr addr be++> + [exomizer raw]
 [exomizer level]         == <--decr be> + [exomizer raw -b -r]
 [exomizer level -f]      == <decr be++> + [exomizer raw]

 <decr be|le> is the decrunch pointer, a 16 bit address written in either big
endian or little endian.

 For lines that contans the raw sub command with the -b flag the decruncher
writes backwards in memory and will predecrement (--) the decrunch address. The
value of the address in the file will be the address that immediately follows
the last byte of the uncrunched data.

 For lines that contains the raw sub command without the -b flag the decruncher
writes forward in memory and will postincrement (++) the decrunch address. The
value of the address in the file will be the address of the first byte of the
uncrunched data.

This also means that it is possible to decrunch level and mem files using the
raw sub command if you use the offset and len options to skip the extra
addresses. Please note that the resulting files will be raw and not prg.

 mem -lnone    => raw -d -b a.out,0,-2
 mem -f -lnone => raw -d a.out,2
 mem           => raw -d -b a.out,2,-2
 mem -f        => raw -d a.out,4
 level         => raw -d -b -r a.out,2
 level -f      => raw -d a.out,2
